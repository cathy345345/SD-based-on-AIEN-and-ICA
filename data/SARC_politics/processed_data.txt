806 ==sep== thanks for taking my comment seriously . ==sep== 1
807 ==sep== ok it 's not just me ? ==sep== 0

864 ==sep== you seem like a very reasonable person who votes based on policy and character rather than anger and an immature worldview ==sep== 1

866 ==sep== what the heck ? ==sep== 0
867 ==sep== i 'm sure murdering children in cold blood will really help their cause . ==sep== 1
868 ==sep== she did nothing illegal so its all fine . ==sep== 1
869 ==sep== it 's been proven that coin tosses have a liberal bias . ==sep== 1
870 ==sep== i guess she will have to blow an intern in the oval office to take their mind off it . ==sep== 1
871 ==sep== all that time spent making up new jobs for poor lazy minorities . ==sep== 1

875 ==sep== the secret meeting that is displayed on nearly ever conservative site on the internet . ==sep== 0

880 ==sep== and yet both parties are the same . ==sep== 1
881 ==sep== nooo we 're not allowed to draw obvious comparisons between trump and dictators of the past because that 's just liberal hyperbole ==sep== 1
882 ==sep== because china is so sneaky and conniving that they 're willing to sacrifice their own short -term gains just to sell climate change to the world . ==sep== 1
883 ==sep== rolling stone hosted the boston bomber ? ==sep== 0
884 ==sep== so glad hillary used her convention to showcase new talent like obama had the opportunity in 2004 . ==sep== 1

900 ==sep== 100 % dead or paid off before he can testify . ==sep== 0
901 ==sep== that 's out of context ! ==sep== 1
902 ==sep== and rasmussen is heavily biase in favor of repubs usually giving them 5 to 9 points above any other poll . ==sep== 0
903 ==sep== but posting on reddit and the internet gives me the same sense of satisfaction as doing something but with less work . ==sep== 1
904 ==sep== yeah but she sent some emails ==sep== 1

917 ==sep== chelsea clinton 2032 ! ==sep== 1
918 ==sep== this isn 't going to get a lot worse . ==sep== 1
919 ==sep== how else can we renovate the football stadium and make it so there are now 146 less parking spots ? ==sep== 1
920 ==sep== those are different because people should be allowed to donate as much as they want when it 's to the right candidate ==sep== 1
921 ==sep== he 's only against the ones he doesn 't benefit from ==sep== 0
922 ==sep== any examples ? ==sep== 1

5174 ==sep== what pesticide product from monsanto is killing bees ? ==sep== 0

8045 ==sep== maybe by not actively attempting to sabotage it ? ==sep== 0
8046 ==sep== so in the us there is checks and balances and festering corruption ? ==sep== 0

8066 ==sep== it worked out so well in kansas and sam brownback . ==sep== 1

8096 ==sep== thats definitely the kind of leadership we want in our next president ! ==sep== 1
8097 ==sep== obviously only muslims can be terrorists ==sep== 1

8099 ==sep== hillary is so far ahead she 's shilling her books in campaign ads ==sep== 1

8112 ==sep== they 'll probably just go to republican leaning areas during the general election and block roads on election day . ==sep== 0

8143 ==sep== how many ratios should he add for each bold number ? ==sep== 0
8144 ==sep== well ya know interrupting hillary is sexist so they wouldn 't wanna do that . ==sep== 1
8145 ==sep== well yeah clearly she 's on death 's door but is also manipulating the entire media to her benefit whilst organizing murders through the shadowy cabal known as the clinton foundation . ==sep== 1
8146 ==sep== so a paid shill using social media to promote an agenda ? ==sep== 1
8147 ==sep== your panties getting all knotted up over this issue is of zero interest to me . ==sep== 0

10572 ==sep== not if you 're a star . ==sep== 1
10573 ==sep== because pragmatism is like satanism ==sep== 1

10575 ==sep== tipped scales ==sep== 0

10618 ==sep== filibuster this communist anti -capitalist marxist filth of a law . ==sep== 1
10619 ==sep== not necessarily . ==sep== 0
10620 ==sep== b -b -but stomping on the flag is an act of love for those who are oppressed ! ==sep== 1
10621 ==sep== any article blaming obama will trend upwards on fox . ==sep== 0

10627 ==sep== i think you dropped this ==sep== 1
10628 ==sep== those protests are very effective . ==sep== 1
10629 ==sep== obama is the best at commenting on things like he cares but not enough to do anything about it . ==sep== 0
10630 ==sep== can we give him trial by fire ? ==sep== 1
10631 ==sep== are they still pissed off about that video ? ==sep== 1

10634 ==sep== i 'm pretty sure it was a typo . ==sep== 0
10635 ==sep== looks like killing scalia is the gift that keeps on giving for hillary ==sep== 1
10636 ==sep== sigh sarcasm comes through so easily in text also . . . . ==sep== 1
10637 ==sep== conservatives /republicans determined to beat this topic to death . ==sep== 0
10638 ==sep== because hamas is such a legitimate threat to israel . ==sep== 1
10639 ==sep== people don 't want to think their candidate is not perfect . ==sep== 0
10640 ==sep== no one said its illegal . . . ==sep== 0
10641 ==sep== you mean he can 't build a wall 10 -15 ' high and nearly a thousand miles long ; also he 'd have mexico pay for it ? ==sep== 1
10642 ==sep== but we wouldn 't want to taint our freedom ==sep== 1
10643 ==sep== yeah but he 's really lost the minority vote ==sep== 1
10644 ==sep== but the 30 caliber clip magazines and assault pistol grips make a firearm so much more scary and efficient at eliminating babies and ethnic minorities ! ==sep== 1
10645 ==sep== legal destruction of government property . ==sep== 1
10646 ==sep== faith healing ==sep== 0
10647 ==sep== all that matters is you vote your conscience ! ==sep== 1

10651 ==sep== japanese are honorary aryans . ==sep== 1
10652 ==sep== it was motivated by obama ! ==sep== 1
10653 ==sep== that makes him smart ==sep== 1
10654 ==sep== and all it takes is one motivated individual to believe him and want to do something about it . ==sep== 0
10655 ==sep== i thought she was perfectly healthy and questioning it made you a conspiracy theorist like alex jones . ==sep== 1
10656 ==sep== just listen to them and pretty soon it will be all rainbows and vacations for everyone . ==sep== 1
10657 ==sep== we need a medical tricorder ! ==sep== 0
10658 ==sep== isn 't that covered by obamacare presently ? ==sep== 1
10659 ==sep== or hes just staying by trumps side and giving ryan the middle finger . . . ==sep== 0
10660 ==sep== the witch must burn ==sep== 1
10661 ==sep== study it out . ==sep== 0

10663 ==sep== of course you dont understand pssh beta ==sep== 1
10664 ==sep== i feel sorry for anyone that seeks employment with a texas public education anywhere on their resume . ==sep== 0
10665 ==sep== but don 't you know that the free market will provide all those things . . .eventually ? ==sep== 1
10666 ==sep== no no no . . . . you see the internet was taken over by a small pro -clinton super pac that employed 40 people . ==sep== 1
10667 ==sep== talking to someone and giving them a random name ? ==sep== 0
10668 ==sep== you forgot this : ==sep== 1
10669 ==sep== yeah . . . that 's why the crazy lady lost her election . ==sep== 1

10671 ==sep== username checks out ==sep== 1
10672 ==sep== but the advertisers win ! ==sep== 0
10673 ==sep== super pacs and the campaign can 't coordinate ==sep== 0
10674 ==sep== people were booing trump so now he takes revenge on boeing ==sep== 1
10675 ==sep== because a police officer would *never * act rashly with a firearm . ==sep== 1
10676 ==sep== i thought he looked shell shocked as well but i took it as something more like i have no idea what i 'm doing . ==sep== 0
10677 ==sep== but gravity is just a theory not a fact ==sep== 1
10678 ==sep== gotta wonder what his concession speech will sound like . ==sep== 0
10679 ==sep== if she 's lied it was most likely to save the life of a child . ==sep== 0
10680 ==sep== from canada : can confirm we are heavily censored ==sep== 1
10681 ==sep== sour grapes from candidates polling in single digits . ==sep== 0
10682 ==sep== look at the debates - that 's how he would act ==sep== 0
10683 ==sep== like all those stupid polls that showed obama ahead of romney when everyone knew from fox and rush that mitt was way ahead . ==sep== 1
10684 ==sep== that 's so much smarter than just making the police behave . ==sep== 1
10685 ==sep== because that makes so much sense if you oppose abortion ==sep== 1
10686 ==sep== your friend sounds like the picture of health ==sep== 1
10687 ==sep== *we need stronger fist control laws in this country . . . * ==sep== 1
10688 ==sep== i know right . . . why can 't everyone just speak american for crying out loud ! ==sep== 1
10689 ==sep== the measure of poise and temperament is trump . ==sep== 1
10690 ==sep== but no racism happened before obama ! ==sep== 1
10691 ==sep== oh but he did it all secretly ==sep== 1
10692 ==sep== just kick back and wait for deathrace to actually happen ==sep== 1
10693 ==sep== but it 's okay as someone in the justice department thought it was all legal so who cares . ==sep== 1
10694 ==sep== it was a joke ==sep== 1
10695 ==sep== oh i 'm sure trump wouldn 't go there ==sep== 1
10696 ==sep== exactly ==sep== 0
10697 ==sep== avalanche on bullshit mountain . ==sep== 0
10698 ==sep== hillary is evergreen and chelsea is energy . ==sep== 0
10699 ==sep== i 'm sure this spot -on analysis will win you many black voters . ==sep== 1
10700 ==sep== at least ron paul would give women a shot of useless estrogen if they could prove it was an 'honest rape ' . ==sep== 0
10701 ==sep== this is why big government needs to be stopped . ==sep== 1
10702 ==sep== sigh shoulda added ==sep== 1
10703 ==sep== i suppose it 's better for the minority to elect a demagogue than the majority . ==sep== 1
10704 ==sep== #drain the swamp ==sep== 1
10705 ==sep== relevant username ==sep== 0
10706 ==sep== please don 't get in the way of the rampant hillary hate train with your silly facts . ==sep== 1
10707 ==sep== if we eliminate entitlements and they buy their own money poverty will disappear ! ==sep== 1
10708 ==sep== don 't stop him he 's on a roll . ==sep== 0
10709 ==sep== the paid internet users are done and gone . ==sep== 1
10710 ==sep== or if the most scandalous and crooked nominee the democrats have ever run gets nominated for the general because it is her turn ==sep== 0
10711 ==sep== i 'm sure it is ==sep== 1
10712 ==sep== then lets hope he injects some science in this magic show . ==sep== 0
10713 ==sep== because a sunburn is *obviously * the worst thing that could come from climate change ! ==sep== 1
10714 ==sep== damn bleeding hear liberal . ==sep== 1
10715 ==sep== the roosevelts would like a word with you . ==sep== 0
10716 ==sep== naw man the real way to succeed is to spend all of your time at general assembly trying to build consensus . ==sep== 1
10717 ==sep== both parties are the same on climate change and war with iran . ==sep== 1
10718 ==sep== obviously had the french had stricter gun control policies they would have prevented the paris attacks ==sep== 1
10719 ==sep== so difficult to imagine a republican lying about the aca . ==sep== 1
10720 ==sep== they should stop expecting handouts and get a job ==sep== 1
10721 ==sep== very profound of you ==sep== 1
10722 ==sep== checks out ! ==sep== 1
10723 ==sep== but there are 168 hours in a week they can always work all that time to afford a place to live . ==sep== 1
10724 ==sep== because americans are constantly being killed in islamic terrorist activities . . . ==sep== 1
10725 ==sep== he forgot nixon and clinton . ==sep== 0
10726 ==sep== probably the candidate who 's supporters dont do their own research lol . ==sep== 1
10727 ==sep== dick cheney puts the callous back in conservative ==sep== 0
10728 ==sep== as bart scott said : can 't wait ==sep== 0
10729 ==sep== gays getting married is what i was told or legalizing pot or woman voting or children going to school instead of working in mines or . . . . . . . . ==sep== 0
10730 ==sep== i can only assume he meant ==sep== 1
10731 ==sep== i 've always hated lawful alignments . ==sep== 0
10732 ==sep== back in reality she 's tied in missouri with trump . ==sep== 0
10733 ==sep== it 's different because trump is a lying racist with ties to the soviet union ==sep== 1
10734 ==sep== i think we should regulate and censor the internet because it gives people too much free speech and that could enable them to spread hateful ideas very quickly and allows terrorists safe communication . ==sep== 1
10735 ==sep== til that there is only one pharma co and it 's not american . ==sep== 0
10736 ==sep== must be another the _donald brigade ==sep== 1
10737 ==sep== france is still smarting from his successful boycott of their products . ==sep== 1
10738 ==sep== like your parents for example ==sep== 1
10739 ==sep== i 'm being sarcastic . ==sep== 1
10740 ==sep== maybe others will also see the fallacy of libertarianism . ==sep== 0
10741 ==sep== it never stopped bush . ==sep== 0
10742 ==sep== working for america is soooo bad . ==sep== 1
10743 ==sep== when he chose to be born in kenya . . obviously . . ==sep== 1
10744 ==sep== but facts are biased towards liberals . ==sep== 1
10745 ==sep== let 's start by being fair first . . . ==sep== 0
10746 ==sep== but holt and clinton conspired to have these word come out of trump 's mouth . ==sep== 1
10747 ==sep== that 's how you know its a conspiracy soo deep the conspirators have fallen for it ==sep== 1
10748 ==sep== grist is a reputable source . ==sep== 0
10749 ==sep== but the will care about galveston . ==sep== 0
10750 ==sep== when did they ever believe in the american dream ? ==sep== 0
10751 ==sep== might as well stay home and not vote then am i right ==sep== 1
10752 ==sep== no . . no no . . clean * *carbon -neutral * * coal ftfy ==sep== 0
10753 ==sep== i think your view may be a bit skewed because you get to live in austin . . . ==sep== 0
10754 ==sep== the pizza guy who is now warning of obama causing the end times ? ==sep== 0
10755 ==sep== you mean people who have no mathematical chance of winning ? ==sep== 0
10756 ==sep== hillary will insist on adding an h to the end of all words . ==sep== 1
10757 ==sep== no flaw in that system . ==sep== 1
10758 ==sep== the people *funding * it or the people *in * it ? ==sep== 0
10759 ==sep== you misspelled resign ==sep== 0
10760 ==sep== i think i 'll run right out and donate $50 to bernie because he really has a chance . ==sep== 1
10761 ==sep== liberalism = devil worshipping ==sep== 1
10762 ==sep== he was being tolerant . ==sep== 1
10763 ==sep== obviously obama is just not as smart as trump . ==sep== 1
10764 ==sep== solyndra is the fast and furious of the republican party before fast and furious became benghazi . ==sep== 0
10765 ==sep== the fact that prc and roc both declare themselves the one china doesn 't exactly help matters either . . . ==sep== 0
10766 ==sep== but he says he 's doing it for the middle class and he wouldn 't lie to us because he isn 't a politicain ==sep== 1
10767 ==sep== and it 's been working so well the last 5 years . ==sep== 1
10768 ==sep== that perfectly describes what happened here . ==sep== 1
10769 ==sep== i am jack 's complete lack of surprise . ==sep== 0

10774 ==sep== thats my presidential candidate ! ==sep== 0
10775 ==sep== one in the same ==sep== 0
10776 ==sep== divide and conquer . ==sep== 0
10777 ==sep== more like naive enough to think billionaires and corporations give them billions of dollars just to be nice ==sep== 0
10778 ==sep== very comparable ==sep== 1
10779 ==sep== they were never *hers * to begin with ==sep== 0
10780 ==sep== they elect a non -voting representative to the house . ==sep== 0
10781 ==sep== stop being so pc ==sep== 1
10782 ==sep== he gonna come get you at night . ==sep== 1
10783 ==sep== better than she is at playing a native american . ==sep== 1
10784 ==sep== but the french are socialists and have death panels . ==sep== 1
10785 ==sep== she did that several times . ==sep== 0
10786 ==sep== my sports team is better than your sports team \ *shoves face full of doritoes * ==sep== 0
10787 ==sep== he 's just tellin ' it like it is ==sep== 1
10788 ==sep== but apple stuff just workstm ! ==sep== 1
10789 ==sep== because a minimum wage hinders people from finding work . ==sep== 1
10790 ==sep== i thought it was lgtbbq ? ==sep== 1
10791 ==sep== you can do that ? ==sep== 1
10792 ==sep== that was sexist ==sep== 1
10793 ==sep== they 'll lively just buy up the rest of the seats next to them and fill them with interns . ==sep== 0
10794 ==sep== real insightful analysis of our political history there . ==sep== 1
10795 ==sep== free markets ! ==sep== 1
10796 ==sep== well it 's a good thing we have all these voter id laws in place to prevent stuff like this from happening . ==sep== 1
10797 ==sep== well pence wasn 't running for president ! ==sep== 1
10798 ==sep== he 's been pretty consistent in what he says at all his rallies ==sep== 0
10799 ==sep== and that 's why obama is responsible for this act of terrorism ==sep== 1
10800 ==sep== and abbott lost the use of his legs when an oak tree fell on him while he was jogging after a storm in houston . ==sep== 0
10801 ==sep== clinton says a lot of things . ==sep== 0
10802 ==sep== and thus trumptv was born and lo it spewed it 's ugliness on the world ==sep== 0
10803 ==sep== it 's all for our safety and to fight terrorists ==sep== 1
10804 ==sep== like a chiropractor . ==sep== 0
10805 ==sep== they 've owned up to it pretty well and discussed how they played pundit when they shouldn 't have . ==sep== 0
10806 ==sep== obviously no one dislikes trump unless they are paid to . ==sep== 1
10807 ==sep== how did i know this would be the top comment ? ==sep== 0
10808 ==sep== i really just want to thank you for proving my point ==sep== 0
10809 ==sep== i welcome the day where we stop thinking critically about the content contained inside of articles to determine the legitimacy of the arguments being forwarded . ==sep== 1
10810 ==sep== that makes him smart . ==sep== 1
10811 ==sep== nothing like a good lynch mob ==sep== 1
10812 ==sep== is it you ? ==sep== 0
10813 ==sep== so just pay a subscription fee to a private company that tracks these things . ==sep== 1
10814 ==sep== she forced trump to tell her she was beautfiul . ==sep== 0
10815 ==sep== they catch everyone but they only stop the republicans . ==sep== 1
10816 ==sep== and definitely just a coincidence . ==sep== 1
10817 ==sep== but at least nobody snorted a xanax ! ==sep== 1
10818 ==sep== way to respond to the point . . . ==sep== 1
10819 ==sep== what did it help in specific ? ==sep== 0
10820 ==sep== a 4 trillion dollar stimulus ? ==sep== 0
10821 ==sep== you 're just saying that because you fear a strong conservative woman . ==sep== 1
10822 ==sep== and the attacks being baseless . ==sep== 0

10828 ==sep== i 'm glad the cops have nothing better to do than kick a woman out of the woman 's restroom . ==sep== 1

10831 ==sep== but the republicans ! ==sep== 1
10832 ==sep== imagine if fdr owned a hotel in germany in the 30s ==sep== 0
10833 ==sep== clinton foundation ==sep== 0

10849 ==sep== because isolated incidences should decide policy . ==sep== 1
10850 ==sep== that would be a great start but it 's not that easy - even if we cut the dod budget in half (by 200 -300 billion /yr ) that 's still not going to be enough to fix our budget problems . ==sep== 0

10861 ==sep== perhaps lauer is more scared of trump setting up his own tv network if he loses the election than of trump being elected president . ==sep== 0
10862 ==sep== because it 's anti -hillary news and this is r /politics . ==sep== 0
10863 ==sep== he forgot the ==sep== 1

16905 ==sep== i should have added a ==sep== 1
16906 ==sep== this isn 't r /liberatarian please delete thing . ==sep== 1
16907 ==sep== neither was obama ! ==sep== 1

16912 ==sep== probably the pipes in your residence . ==sep== 0
16913 ==sep== he was giving those children solid work skills and the ability to get a job when they get out of school . ==sep== 1

16915 ==sep== kansas ' budget has been doing pretty well with its massive tea party tax cuts . ==sep== 1
16916 ==sep== she should be deported . ==sep== 0
16917 ==sep== r .i .n .o . ==sep== 1
16918 ==sep== i 'm glad we have such an educated and responsible electorate ==sep== 1
16919 ==sep== and supply side economics works 100 % of the time . ==sep== 1
16920 ==sep== i 'm so surprised that there 's no mention on r /politics of how the same poll shows hillary increasing her national lead over sanders from 19 points in december to 25 now . ==sep== 1
16921 ==sep== i personally think the term natural born citizen is discriminatory to citizens born via c -section . ==sep== 1
16922 ==sep== has obama said the v word yet ? ==sep== 0
16923 ==sep== what a pathetically scathing attack comment you 've posted . ==sep== 1
16924 ==sep== that and medical advancements ==sep== 0
16925 ==sep== welp time for another crusade it looks like ==sep== 1
16926 ==sep== i 'm sure if dems were majority they would be completely open to a conservative president assigning conservative judges . ==sep== 1
16927 ==sep== for refusing to endorse a man that clearly goes against his values and policies ? ==sep== 0
16928 ==sep== you lost . ==sep== 0
16929 ==sep== no way this was stage ! ==sep== 1
16930 ==sep== *colour ==sep== 1

16932 ==sep== no it 's all just a republican smear campaign . ==sep== 1
16933 ==sep== would you also say that the iraqi war was a good idea because at the time polls showed that it had huge popular support ? ==sep== 0
16934 ==sep== clearly all the emails were written between putin and assange and donald . ==sep== 1
16935 ==sep== the cities can relate to eachother yes thank you for agreeing with me . ==sep== 0
16936 ==sep== but . . . i thought the defunding health benefits would stop people from needing the services they had ? ==sep== 1
16937 ==sep== so if we can just get the shootings up even higher we should see crime fall off completely . ==sep== 1
16938 ==sep== canada . ==sep== 1
16939 ==sep== yes and as you can see their stock prices tumbled after the profits caps were announced . ==sep== 1
16940 ==sep== so we should now be regulating private business profits because they choose to pay the minimum wage ? ==sep== 0
16941 ==sep== she did say yes and when she saw him macking on another woman she than said he 's dead ==sep== 0
16942 ==sep== i know my personal wealth almost doubled in the last 5 years . ==sep== 1
16943 ==sep== can 't wait to see how the polls react to this one . ==sep== 0
16944 ==sep== that 's fine but the real option is a corrupt washington insider who thinks transperency and accountability are bad words vs a uneducated highschool bully ==sep== 0
16945 ==sep== actually being progressive ==sep== 1
16946 ==sep== i 'm confused . . . i thought the gop 's official position was that government shouldn 't be telling private businesses to do things they aren 't comfortable with . ==sep== 0
16947 ==sep== looks like the only one who can stump the trump is trump himself . ==sep== 1
16948 ==sep== probably opposed to state owned and private prisons for the same reason ==sep== 1
16949 ==sep== you 're absolutely correct . ==sep== 0
16950 ==sep== talk about semantics ==sep== 1
16951 ==sep== that 's exactly why we should close the border to all christians . ==sep== 1
16952 ==sep== think of the day when we can finally link the name trump with loser ==sep== 0
16953 ==sep== i thought this only happened in the south . ==sep== 1
16954 ==sep== it is about time this campaign started to get interesting . ==sep== 1
16955 ==sep== or that obama is just one of the best public speakers we have ever seen . ==sep== 0
16956 ==sep== kasich just defunded planned parenthood in ohio ==sep== 0
16957 ==sep== to quote ron white : you can 't fix stupid . ==sep== 0
16958 ==sep== something we we all wish for ourselves . ==sep== 0
16959 ==sep== everyone knows he replaced it with a bust of stalin ==sep== 1
16960 ==sep== you 're obviously a sexist if you think that ==sep== 1
16961 ==sep== just making america great again ! ==sep== 1
16962 ==sep== must all be part of trump 's plan ==sep== 1
16963 ==sep== very presidential . ==sep== 1
16964 ==sep== anything less would be typical leftwing socialist politics . ==sep== 1
16965 ==sep== someone didn 't read the article . ==sep== 0
16966 ==sep== your comments about the domain add nothing to the conversation . ==sep== 0
16967 ==sep== but it 's just the free market . . . ==sep== 1
16968 ==sep== isn 't it great to know that our appointed officials are now operating above the law ? ==sep== 1
16969 ==sep== there 's literally no difference between palestine and mexico ==sep== 1
16970 ==sep== i like how everybody finds their own unique reason to hate trump ==sep== 0
16971 ==sep== except it does . . . as many well known economists agree on . ==sep== 0
16972 ==sep== well then all those jew loving republicans better vote for him then . ==sep== 1
16973 ==sep== well obviously because that plot didn 't target americans . ==sep== 1
16974 ==sep== i knew this would happen ! ==sep== 1
16975 ==sep== i think they dropped this ==sep== 1
16976 ==sep== jenniferlawrencethumbsup .gif ==sep== 0

16982 ==sep== read all about it in his new book . . . ==sep== 1
16983 ==sep== yeah maybe bernie should create an email scandal just for all the extra press ! ==sep== 1
16984 ==sep== keep on phonebanking . ==sep== 0
16985 ==sep== i wonder how much these shills were paid for the life of their dead son . ==sep== 1
16986 ==sep== of course they forgot to mention the fbi supplied the underwear . . . ==sep== 1
16987 ==sep== the speed of light was constructed to store photons . ==sep== 1
16988 ==sep== actually it 's impossible for corporations to lose money because they 're evil ==sep== 1
16989 ==sep== here 's a conspiracy theory : maybe pence and conway are purposefully discouraging trump from attending these briefings so trump doesn 't go tweeting classified information at 3 am . ==sep== 0
16990 ==sep== obama still is in office he 's taking our guns away anyday now ! ==sep== 1
16991 ==sep== that attitude should be good for business . ==sep== 1
16992 ==sep== it 's how they pretend trump didn 't lose . ==sep== 0
16993 ==sep== but voting is hard q -q ==sep== 1
16994 ==sep== til a cop is not the police . ==sep== 0
16995 ==sep== i guess now we like that southern belle lindsey graham . ==sep== 0
16996 ==sep== easy fix : just give them some (more ) tax breaks to offset their losses . ==sep== 1
16997 ==sep== don 't forget about the emails ! ==sep== 1
16998 ==sep== still sexy . ==sep== 0
16999 ==sep== it happened in the 1968 election . ==sep== 0
17000 ==sep== it 's much better your president lies to get you into a war than to keep people from finding out you let a fat girl blow you . ==sep== 1
17001 ==sep== you must have missed last nights episode where she called for the nationalization of every major industry . . . ==sep== 1
17002 ==sep== does he know what they do to adulterers in theocracies ? ==sep== 0
17003 ==sep== could it be because the entire msm has promoted racism at every opportunity ? ==sep== 0
17004 ==sep== he could : a ) raise money for progressive primary candidates b ) stump for progressive primary candidates c ) endorse progressive primary candidates d ) mention progressive primary candidates which of those has he done ? ==sep== 0
17005 ==sep== fascinating . ==sep== 1
17006 ==sep== sweet a four month old article . ==sep== 0

17013 ==sep== but they were white ==sep== 1
17014 ==sep== hopefully more like the party of more people voted for anyone other than trump . ==sep== 0
17015 ==sep== right i totally forgot when obama started the war in afghanistan . ==sep== 1
17016 ==sep== corruption is only what 's illegal ==sep== 1
17017 ==sep== eventually automation is cheaper than h1 -b 's too . ==sep== 0
17018 ==sep== rekt ==sep== 1
17019 ==sep== why would they spend so much money denying something that doesnt exist ? ==sep== 1
17020 ==sep== because sarah palin told me there 'd be death panels . ==sep== 1
17021 ==sep== fully agree . ==sep== 0
17022 ==sep== they probably say hillary was the 19th 9 /11 hijacker or at least that 's what i 'll just assume and never follow up on ==sep== 1
17023 ==sep== disrespectful tone you pc brah ? ==sep== 0
17024 ==sep== record : corrected thank you ==sep== 1
17025 ==sep== where we 're going we don 't need space ! ==sep== 1

17028 ==sep== you sound like an upstanding citizen . ==sep== 1
17029 ==sep== thank goodness that has never happened with a democracy ==sep== 1
17030 ==sep== can 't really compare a push or shove to being waterboarded . ==sep== 1
17031 ==sep== what about the bodily autonomy lost when a man is forced to work and pay child support for a child he may not have wanted ? ==sep== 0
17032 ==sep== we need to watch carefully to see if she 's blinking help me in morse code during tv appearances . ==sep== 0
17033 ==sep== i really wish i could give a dozen up votes for this comment . ==sep== 0
17034 ==sep== and taking advantage of that cheap housing is just called good business ! ==sep== 1
17035 ==sep== i know i wasn 't invited to the party but mind if i piss in the punch bowl ? ==sep== 0
17036 ==sep== why hasn 't he done this already ? ==sep== 0
17037 ==sep== right . . . because mass domestic servailamce and indefinite detention without a trial is soooo constitutional ==sep== 1
17038 ==sep== amazing how simple it really is ! ==sep== 1
17039 ==sep== but those young 'uns don 't bother voting ! ==sep== 1
17040 ==sep== was it holstered or was be brandishing it . ==sep== 0
17041 ==sep== these two things must be totally unrelated and in no way have racist intent . ==sep== 1
17042 ==sep== actually i 'm more willing to roll the dice and shake shit up than accept more of the same . ==sep== 0
17043 ==sep== so why are people so dissatisfied with obama ? ==sep== 1
17044 ==sep== what 's that ? ==sep== 1
17045 ==sep== haha good one ==sep== 1
17046 ==sep== weekend at trumps ==sep== 0

17049 ==sep== pre -thriller mike would like a word ==sep== 0
17050 ==sep== say hello to your future king . ==sep== 1
17051 ==sep== moderate indies are an anathema . ==sep== 1
17052 ==sep== but . . .but . . .democrats and republicans are just different sides of the same coin ! ==sep== 1
17053 ==sep== do you really want trump as president ? ==sep== 1
17054 ==sep== but war helps the economy . . . ==sep== 1
17055 ==sep== which was totally what he was trying to do ==sep== 1
17056 ==sep== great source ; we all stand corrected ! ==sep== 1
17057 ==sep== solid retort you 've convinced me ! ==sep== 1
17058 ==sep== jk lol doesn 't matter because the judge declared no take backsies . ==sep== 0
17059 ==sep== she supported civil unions long before it was popular ==sep== 0
17060 ==sep== you are arguing the merits of dogs over guns because they are less deadly this is pointless goodbye ==sep== 0
17061 ==sep== luckily trump is totally putting her in prison . . . ==sep== 1
17062 ==sep== might be part of his plan to ensure reelection ==sep== 1
17063 ==sep== i saw thar truck near hillary clinton 's house after she was asked to publish the speech transcripts . ==sep== 1
17064 ==sep== but but . . . competition drives down costs ! ==sep== 1
17065 ==sep== is anyone really surprised that the guy who ran his campaign on lies and bs actually lied to the voters about his intentions . . ==sep== 0
17066 ==sep== it would be much better for them to not say anything and have the gun be used in a violent crime ==sep== 1
17067 ==sep== oh you 're such an obama hater ! ==sep== 1
17068 ==sep== lol ==sep== 0
17069 ==sep== from the party and state that thinks they own women 's uteruses . ==sep== 0
17070 ==sep== ass a former congressman you can 't help but trust this guy . ==sep== 1
17071 ==sep== which is why they 're running on the most liberal platform in history . ==sep== 1
17072 ==sep== just remember . . .president obama is only nominating someone as a political stunt and has absolutely nothing to do with governing the country . ==sep== 1
17073 ==sep== but any vote not for clinton is a vote for trump ! ==sep== 1
17074 ==sep== solid reasoning ==sep== 1
17075 ==sep== and how will perry help with the diversity problem ? ==sep== 0
17076 ==sep== how about we just blame white people instead ? ==sep== 1
17077 ==sep== fucking scrubs need to stop complaining and just eat the shit sandwich like the rest of us . ==sep== 1
17078 ==sep== he flies coach . ==sep== 0
17079 ==sep== you forgot the ==sep== 1
17080 ==sep== are they literally managing a candidate 's presidential campaign ? ==sep== 0
17081 ==sep== about fucking time someone stood up to the electorate . ==sep== 1
17082 ==sep== well at least the kids can go watch their football team . . . . .right ? ==sep== 1
17083 ==sep== those two things aren 't mutually exclusive . ==sep== 0
17084 ==sep== i 'm sure this will go exactly as bloomberg expects heading into the midterms ==sep== 1
17085 ==sep== well . . . there it goes . . . welcome to communism i guess . . . . people will really miss their freedoms . ==sep== 1
17086 ==sep== that 's exactly how the ccw trained person would react ==sep== 1
17087 ==sep== not the entire election but part of it . . . ==sep== 0
17088 ==sep== how else do you expect them to stop the sjws from censoring speech ? ==sep== 1
17089 ==sep== way to put yourself in their shoes ==sep== 1
17090 ==sep== you really should seek help ==sep== 0
17091 ==sep== obviously news reporters that work for clinton are more trustworthy than professors . ==sep== 1
17092 ==sep== good thing that has no chance of escalating tensions with china . ==sep== 1
17093 ==sep== that 's sexist ! ==sep== 1
17094 ==sep== we also have to ensure that there are fewer companies providing access to the internet to continue to make the market . . . . . .more vibrant . ==sep== 0
17095 ==sep== if they do they will soon be in mentioned history books together with the whig party . ==sep== 0
17096 ==sep== ya your reply right shouldnt have the calories or ingredients on them either just google it . ==sep== 1

17102 ==sep== the dirty esjay -doubleyou thought police have gone too far ! ==sep== 1
17103 ==sep== a well thought out counterpoint to the article jfrat71 . ==sep== 1
17104 ==sep== yeah because infowars and alex jones are just the most reputable journalists ==sep== 1
17105 ==sep== trump would make a great leader but i can 't say this publicly because an entire ethnicity would rightfully hate me . ==sep== 1
17106 ==sep== yes because no democrats were talking about income inequality until sanders came around . ==sep== 1
17107 ==sep== context and precedent is just a straw man ! ==sep== 1
17108 ==sep== that 's because republicans didn 't let him spend the money . ==sep== 1
17109 ==sep== ooohhh . . .a trump scam . . .that 's never happened before ! ==sep== 1
17110 ==sep== ya i get the whole israel criticism against clinton but does anyone else care about how hillary (very likely negatively ) will affect our relationship with russia ? ==sep== 0
17111 ==sep== hopefully the anti -vaxxers can unite and send a little cash trumps way ==sep== 1
17112 ==sep== it sounds like the guard was an asshole about it but it is apparently against the law to bring in books . ==sep== 0
17113 ==sep== true ==sep== 0
17114 ==sep== it 's rigged ! ==sep== 1
17115 ==sep== but both parties are exactly the same ! ==sep== 1
17116 ==sep== you should have gone to the fortune teller more frequently and paid them to foresee the future in which you would lose that job before ever having the child . ==sep== 1
17117 ==sep== so how much did you sell your account for ? ==sep== 1
17118 ==sep== what a true hero she is ==sep== 1
17119 ==sep== times like this i 'm glad as hell texas is going purple and he 'll likely be a one term senator . . . ==sep== 0
17120 ==sep== wow talk about delusional . ==sep== 0
17121 ==sep== he 's 70 but he is the oldest person to assume to presidency . ==sep== 0
17122 ==sep== because everyone knows black parents have hypnotic control over their children ==sep== 1
17123 ==sep== whereas no one on the right every threatened obama 's life . ==sep== 1
17124 ==sep== i do hear joe lieberman avoids bald black men with purple lightsabers . ==sep== 0
17125 ==sep== thanks reagan . ==sep== 1
17126 ==sep== but at least he 's not a dingo . . . ==sep== 0
17127 ==sep== no they are just standing up against the murderous clintons who shamefully tried to discredit them . ==sep== 1
17128 ==sep== what is it with you reality -based people and your obsession with facts ? ==sep== 1
17129 ==sep== it might have been positive when he mentioned it . ==sep== 0
17130 ==sep== great endorsement ! ==sep== 1
17131 ==sep== but . . .but . . .but . . .she 's raising so much more money than donald trump . ==sep== 1
17132 ==sep== i hope you just forgot to add the ==sep== 1
17133 ==sep== the only place i actually see any of that being reported is when police officers attempt to expose corrupt policy handed down by the politicians in charge . ==sep== 0
17134 ==sep== bernie better watch out before he becomes an sjw and shoves socialist policies and progressive views down our throats ==sep== 1
17135 ==sep== because she 's obviously a huge champion of all those things ==sep== 1
17136 ==sep== keep telling yourself that . ==sep== 0
17137 ==sep== it will shoot to the top like a rocket . ==sep== 1
17138 ==sep== so we 're the _donald ? ==sep== 0
17139 ==sep== i live in kentucky and am afraid that 's what bevin is going to do if he hasn 't already . ==sep== 0
17140 ==sep== and taxes are literally armed robbery ! ==sep== 1
17141 ==sep== stop being sexist ! ==sep== 1
17142 ==sep== i have no problem with that . ==sep== 0
17143 ==sep== well then you must be a racist ! ==sep== 1
17144 ==sep== nopenopenopenopenopenope ==sep== 1

17149 ==sep== why do you hate libertarians ? ==sep== 0
17150 ==sep== yup the 94 crime bill and the welfare reform she helped push sure was a net positive . ==sep== 1
17151 ==sep== so how do you know what percentage they represent ? ==sep== 0
17152 ==sep== i concede . ==sep== 0
17153 ==sep== the man definitely has his priorities in order . ==sep== 1
17154 ==sep== let 's not forget it was an illegal donation . ==sep== 0
17155 ==sep== yeah but the new york times is owned by a mexican ==sep== 1
17156 ==sep== or maybe he can do what rand paul did and just run away . ==sep== 0
17157 ==sep== whatever you say boss . ==sep== 1
17158 ==sep== real ? ==sep== 1
17159 ==sep== how could you compare the assassination of a brown terrorist to intruding on the rights of americans ? ==sep== 1
17160 ==sep== just remember since labor is 100 % of the costs of a product the cost of a good will increase yugely ! ==sep== 1
17161 ==sep== someone forgot the ==sep== 1
17162 ==sep== everyone who disagreed with madame popular should have dropped out because it was her turn ==sep== 1
17163 ==sep== someone just left their samsung plugged in . ==sep== 1

17171 ==sep== taking fat rails of fairy dust is how sanders camp got where it is today . ==sep== 0
17172 ==sep== iran was looking pretty good until we killed mosaddeq but hey at least we stopped communsim from sprouting there . ==sep== 1
17173 ==sep== i wonder why msm outlets aren 't paying important stuff like this more attention . ==sep== 1
17174 ==sep== you obviously don 't work in our legal system if you haven 't heard the term new jim crow . ==sep== 0
17175 ==sep== shouldn 't a twist be unexpected ? ==sep== 1
17176 ==sep== don 't forget the horrifying leftist media . ==sep== 1
17177 ==sep== how can anyone stop the mexican rapists if they have no experience committing sexual assault ? ==sep== 1
17178 ==sep== because trump rugged the primaries . ==sep== 1
17179 ==sep== she is essentially a republican ==sep== 1

20022 ==sep== it was sarcasm broooooo . ==sep== 1
20023 ==sep== you mean the guy who would run for either party is a moderate ? ==sep== 1

20053 ==sep== yeah but they are more efficient so who cares ? ==sep== 1
20054 ==sep== hugo boss ? ==sep== 0
20055 ==sep== because r /politics says so . . ==sep== 1
20056 ==sep== but clinton is the crooked one . ==sep== 1
20057 ==sep== i can 't wait until you pay for me to go to college ! ==sep== 0
20058 ==sep== so whats the latest score in this game terrorists vs cops ==sep== 1

20061 ==sep== it must feel great to have that privilege . ==sep== 1
20062 ==sep== now we can teach those kids a lesson ! ==sep== 1
20063 ==sep== so the fact it 's impractical is purely coincidental . ==sep== 0
20064 ==sep== is the poster making the nearly sacrilegious claim that more guns and a free shot law is not decreasing gun deaths ? ==sep== 1
20065 ==sep== cause evil trump is racist and want to kill black people ==sep== 1
20066 ==sep== can 't imagine if that happened like that it would be good for the democratic party in the election . ==sep== 0
20067 ==sep== keep telling yourself that . ==sep== 0

20526 ==sep== i don 't think assault is included in the legal consequences of free speech . ==sep== 0

20528 ==sep== . . .with the full force of the united states military . ==sep== 1
20529 ==sep== i kind of like his routine stump speech right now . . . ==sep== 0

20538 ==sep== ward connerly ? ==sep== 1
20539 ==sep== how can a union that small contribute that much money ? ==sep== 1
20540 ==sep== but you 'd let him do it because he 's a star . ==sep== 1
20541 ==sep== you 're not allowed to say that here join the circle jerk or leave ==sep== 1
20542 ==sep== it 's their own fault for being too poor or lazy to go get the id . ==sep== 1

20544 ==sep== they trade lobster and filet mignon for hooch and crack cocaine ! ==sep== 1

20546 ==sep== this seems like a legit and non biased study . ==sep== 1
20547 ==sep== are you saying the racist groups that the charleston shooter referenced were liberals ? ==sep== 0
20548 ==sep== why should it be assumed that a video of someone spray painting a word on a vehicle after others had threateningly held a finger in the general direction of them would be staged ? ==sep== 0
20549 ==sep== stay lying . ==sep== 0
20550 ==sep== i have a brother that consistently votes republican and told me last night that all the candidates scare the shit out of him . ==sep== 0
20551 ==sep== more than 3 or 4 % . ==sep== 0
20552 ==sep== because the former co -chair of hillary 's 2008 campaign never talked or coordinated her actions with the 2016 clinton campaign ? ==sep== 1
20553 ==sep== i realize it can be easy to forget that making an accusation automatically counts as guilt but try to remember it ==sep== 1
20554 ==sep== oh that must be what khan was referring to . ==sep== 1
20555 ==sep== yeah they should pass something like cispa to keep reddit from every doing this kind of damage again . ==sep== 1
20556 ==sep== but how can a socialist /marxist program lead to greater capitalism ? ==sep== 1
20557 ==sep== and it 's closer to vermont . ==sep== 1
20558 ==sep== no . ==sep== 0
20559 ==sep== and that 's why we have the electoral college . ==sep== 0
20560 ==sep== but people who study 16th century ventriloquism add just as much to society as doctors do ! ==sep== 1
20561 ==sep== isn 't he busy now leading the knights of the vale ? ==sep== 0
20562 ==sep== maybe they don 't want to be hunted down by the ministry of truth . ==sep== 1
20563 ==sep== he likes soldiers who don 't die . ==sep== 0
20564 ==sep== but . . .but jobs are seasonal in july ! ==sep== 1
20565 ==sep== that biased liberal media is constantly using trump 's own words against him instead of twisting them to mean what he retroactively says they meant . ==sep== 1
20566 ==sep== democrats would never stoop to that level ==sep== 1
20567 ==sep== saying that we should believe a pathological liar over our intelligence community makes perfect sense . ==sep== 1
20568 ==sep== but if someone is bad you must treat them as 100 % wrong . ==sep== 1
20569 ==sep== right wing lies ==sep== 0

20571 ==sep== because we have to do something ! ==sep== 1
20572 ==sep== fyi you are missing the ==sep== 1
20573 ==sep== because the federal worker is evil just like teachers etc . . . ==sep== 1
20574 ==sep== i guess you missed the show he did on her emails and the clinton foundation correct ? ==sep== 0
20575 ==sep== you forgot the ==sep== 1
20576 ==sep== i thought trump and bernie were agreed on so many issues ! ==sep== 1
20577 ==sep== i think pat roberts ought to attack them for handing out the tools of abortion . ==sep== 1
20578 ==sep== but but but but he said he would put it in a blind trust run by his children so he wouldn 't profit from his policies . . . . . ==sep== 1
20579 ==sep== that must be why they are supporting him so adamantly ==sep== 1
20580 ==sep== wasn 't this supposed to be the damning evidence that could finally end clinton 's reign of tyranny or something like that ? ==sep== 0
20581 ==sep== cruz isn 't counting on winning the election as mush as he is counting on negotiating for it . ==sep== 0
20582 ==sep== wow this is the first bush to ever lie to the public . ==sep== 1

20592 ==sep== you gotta admit our conservatives /republicans are devilishly clever . ==sep== 0
20593 ==sep== now can we call him a nazi ? ==sep== 1

20609 ==sep== they must have stopped calling that silent majority ==sep== 1
20610 ==sep== and didn 't we learn that that 's pay -for -play if done through the clinton foundation ? ==sep== 0
20611 ==sep== because uprooting your entire life and moving to the other side of the country is an easy thing to do . ==sep== 1
20612 ==sep== i feel like people are mistaking his obnoxious confidence for honesty ==sep== 0

20617 ==sep== salty you are . ==sep== 0
20618 ==sep== by banning assault weapons amirite ? ==sep== 1

20624 ==sep== im sure the poor guy was suffering from a mental illness . ==sep== 1
20625 ==sep== good luck with that . ==sep== 0

20632 ==sep== that 's his cross to bear . ==sep== 0

20779 ==sep== it 's her turn ! ==sep== 1
20780 ==sep== pretty sure the internment camps were why we won wwii . . . right ? ==sep== 1
20781 ==sep== but you are definitely worth listening to ==sep== 1
20782 ==sep== clearly this is only because mcauliffe is trying to steal this election by letting felons vote ! ==sep== 1
20783 ==sep== she just wants to do that so we all get irradiated . ==sep== 1
20784 ==sep== it 's okay though because it 's her turn . ==sep== 1

20790 ==sep== i too support candidates who disrupt rescue and relief efforts for a photo op ! ==sep== 1
20791 ==sep== saying stuff like that is why trump won . ==sep== 1
20792 ==sep== because anyone that stands up for your rights and other peoples rights is a con . ==sep== 1
20793 ==sep== any day now . . . he 's just laying in wait . . . you 'll see ; next year it 's going down . . . ==sep== 1

20803 ==sep== at least hes not a muslim . ==sep== 1
20804 ==sep== for many people taking a job lowers your chance of getting a career . ==sep== 0

20808 ==sep== he doesn 't need to know how because he 's going to hire the best people ! ==sep== 1
20809 ==sep== that 's why he got congressional approval for libya . ==sep== 1
20810 ==sep== yes that 's why all those low income city voters love clinton ==sep== 1
20811 ==sep== the title makes him sound like a wizard . ==sep== 0
20812 ==sep== the rob ford effect . ==sep== 0
20813 ==sep== clearly they just respect bernie too much to attack him ==sep== 1

20817 ==sep== yeah that 's certainly the one and only reason any republican doesn 't favor trump . ==sep== 1
20818 ==sep== i 'm sure something like voter fraud would be aired by the main stream media . ==sep== 1
20819 ==sep== especially when (smart people are saying ) those funds go to nambla . ==sep== 0
20820 ==sep== i think she said they want your name to put on the nomination no idea though ==sep== 0
20821 ==sep== rekt ==sep== 0

20825 ==sep== m 'acaroni ==sep== 0
20826 ==sep== trump could demand that ryan and priebus fellate him on c -span as a show of loyalty and ryan would have to think about it for awhile (priebus would agree without hesitation ) ==sep== 0
20827 ==sep== there 's that liberal media at work again . ==sep== 1
20828 ==sep== it is a common misconception . ==sep== 0
20829 ==sep== that 's debatable ==sep== 1

20831 ==sep== we need to move on to the next benghazi 2 .0 ==sep== 0
20832 ==sep== i 'm sure after he answers all of these questions it will all be put the rest and we will never ever hear anything about it ever again . ==sep== 1

21042 ==sep== uh uh . . . it 's unbiased ==sep== 1
21043 ==sep== and yet he is successful and has 10 billion . ==sep== 1
21044 ==sep== . . .good one . ==sep== 1

21056 ==sep== its a vast media conspiracy ! ==sep== 1
21057 ==sep== and some police dogs . ==sep== 0
21058 ==sep== but then we 'd have to end our war in afghanistan . . . : ( ==sep== 1
21059 ==sep== i 'm sure the house committee will have comey all over this in a few days ==sep== 1
21060 ==sep== oh good that means she 'll win ! ==sep== 1
21061 ==sep== did you even watch trump 's speech last night ==sep== 0

21071 ==sep== he 'll restrict research funding to religious organizations . ==sep== 1
21072 ==sep== then why are republicans electing racists and anti -science nut jobs to represent them ? ==sep== 0
21073 ==sep== they 're gonna have to figure out how to get over that wall first of course . ==sep== 1
21074 ==sep== he hasn 't endorsed trump . ==sep== 0
21075 ==sep== the mere truth isn 't going to get calgary ted into the white house . ==sep== 0
21076 ==sep== he does trust the jews for his money ==sep== 1
21077 ==sep== and michelle obama *is * black . ==sep== 0
21078 ==sep== i demand an apology to all those poor nazis ! ==sep== 1
21079 ==sep== this further proves she ain 't human cause no human being could sit through 8 hours of that bullshit . ==sep== 1
21080 ==sep== but dont you know clinton is a lizard person antichrist whose deletion of emails makes her literally hitler stalin mussolini and a giant black widow who will eat your babies this is direct evidence she is pure evil incarnate who needs to be purged we cant allow her to continue because she deleted some emails and a random internet person asked how to hide who sent some emails ==sep== 1
21081 ==sep== god damn obama being divisive again ! ==sep== 1
21082 ==sep== that would require a non -zero level of maturity . ==sep== 0

21084 ==sep== the irony . . . ==sep== 0
21085 ==sep== are you saying the peanut farmer has only read an hour on this subject ? ==sep== 1
21086 ==sep== what does ignorant mean ? ==sep== 1
21087 ==sep== the reason is because bill clinton got a blowjob . ==sep== 1
21088 ==sep== the fact it isn 't praising hillary . ==sep== 1
21089 ==sep== the only acceptable spending is welfare for rich people and rich corporate persons . ==sep== 0

21095 ==sep== right -wingers aint terrorists - theys patriots ! ==sep== 1
21096 ==sep== because jesus was all about superior firepower . ==sep== 1
21097 ==sep== you might take a look around and see what 's actually happening in the world . ==sep== 0
21098 ==sep== the only people who don 't vote for my candidate are ignorant retards ! ==sep== 1
21099 ==sep== you forgot the ==sep== 1

21103 ==sep== couldn 't happen to a more punch -able face . ==sep== 0
21104 ==sep== americans : don 't let the door hit you on the way out . ==sep== 0

21111 ==sep== a douche killed my father ! ==sep== 1
21112 ==sep== he already said that . ==sep== 0
21113 ==sep== oh you picked up on that too ? ==sep== 1
21114 ==sep== where do you have evidence he choked her ? ==sep== 0
21115 ==sep== my thoughts exactly . ==sep== 0
21116 ==sep== if you want to get technical about it the u .s is most accurately defined by the term polyarchy but yeah a republic and a democracy are not mutually exclusive . ==sep== 0
21117 ==sep== more than a few religious right -wingers are catholic but most are not . ==sep== 0
21118 ==sep== i expect an e -mail will soon be uncovered showing she 's been paid off by the clinton foundation . ==sep== 1
21119 ==sep== lol it 's alright when it 's all white . ==sep== 1
21120 ==sep== someone thinking that they can control what a woman does with her own body is a misogynist no matter what way you want to twist it . ==sep== 0
21121 ==sep== is this early news that sanders is winning big in wv ? ==sep== 1
21122 ==sep== i bet he called putin and asked him to hack the credit card data of his customers . ==sep== 1
21123 ==sep== you can upvote both ==sep== 0
21124 ==sep== only if you hate net neutrality . ==sep== 0
21125 ==sep== it might lead them to vote in other elections when they might otherwise not have voted at all . ==sep== 0
21126 ==sep== fire bomb his campaign and get the democrats to pay for the repairs . ==sep== 1
21127 ==sep== don 't you know journalists are only supposed to publish information if it _promotes _ the government 's agenda ? ==sep== 1
21128 ==sep== but it 's about momentum ==sep== 1
21129 ==sep== did you hear about the time i was in a club and watching women have sex ? ==sep== 0
21130 ==sep== she would only be following the clinton tradition ! ==sep== 1
21131 ==sep== that stinks . ==sep== 0
21132 ==sep== but beer is a ln american past time . . unlike that god damn hippy weed . ==sep== 1
21133 ==sep== well that doesn 't sound threatening in any way shape or form . ==sep== 1
21134 ==sep== when it 's a conservative it totally matters though ==sep== 1
21135 ==sep== maybe ==sep== 0
21136 ==sep== you sound butthurt ==sep== 0
21137 ==sep== someone should explain to mr magoo that the little red squiggly line under a word means it 's spelled wrong ==sep== 0
21138 ==sep== but he was charging at him ! ==sep== 1
21139 ==sep== and that 's why i 'm voting republican . ==sep== 1
21140 ==sep== why is unemployment is calculated differently when a democrat is president ? ==sep== 1
21141 ==sep== speak spanish ==sep== 1
21142 ==sep== the circumstances surrounding this latest piece do not at all call into question its credibility . ==sep== 1
21143 ==sep== what ? ==sep== 0
21144 ==sep== stop victim blaming ! ==sep== 1
21145 ==sep== a very well reasoned rebuttal that really shows what is wrong with the analysis . ==sep== 1
21146 ==sep== do you want your kids speaking mexican ? ==sep== 1
21147 ==sep== but if we shoot more of the other side we 'll eventually win this fight ! ==sep== 1
21148 ==sep== this is so relevant to the election . ==sep== 1
21149 ==sep== they both allegedly tickle yer inerds but there 's little evidence beyond that . ==sep== 0
21150 ==sep== sounds like another repube jobs bill to me . ==sep== 1
21151 ==sep== yeah i guess not . ==sep== 0
21152 ==sep== you should read some of the books i mentioned . ==sep== 0
21153 ==sep== no this is the first we are hearing of it . ==sep== 1
21154 ==sep== but it 's an opinion that i don 't agree with . ==sep== 1
21155 ==sep== the patriarchy ==sep== 1
21156 ==sep== the level of mental gymnastics required to sustain this level of reasoning is cartman -esque . ==sep== 0
21157 ==sep== but it 's hillary 's turn ! ==sep== 1
21158 ==sep== i 'm sure 13 -year -olds are the main customers of most drug dealers . ==sep== 1
21159 ==sep== i bet the fake news site common dreams also believes that federal firearms registries are to advance political witch hunts too . ==sep== 1
21160 ==sep== but she 's a woman ! ==sep== 1
21161 ==sep== clearly you 're an expert . ==sep== 1
21162 ==sep== but that 's haaaard ==sep== 1
21163 ==sep== you dropped this : ==sep== 1
21164 ==sep== ah yes - that 's the kind of short -termism that made the us what it is today ! ==sep== 1
21165 ==sep== but . . . clinton kept email on this server instead of that one ! ==sep== 1
21166 ==sep== you dropped this ==sep== 1
21167 ==sep== this whole idea of all of us having civil liberties and equality under the constitution is totally stifling states . ==sep== 1
21168 ==sep== yes because all those old dogs have such a wonderful record of being right about trump this election season . ==sep== 1
21169 ==sep== wimmens is men 's property fer breeding and ain 't good fer nuthin ' else ! ==sep== 1
21170 ==sep== i 'd laugh harder if sanders endorses trump . ==sep== 0

21172 ==sep== you forgot the ==sep== 1
21173 ==sep== i would if he went less crazy in the general ==sep== 0
21174 ==sep== would you rather they talk about their looks ==sep== 1
21175 ==sep== right because they 've always been so great to hillary ==sep== 1
21176 ==sep== america 's true hero . ==sep== 1
21177 ==sep== that is the idea . ==sep== 0
21178 ==sep== both parties are the same ==sep== 1
21179 ==sep== so when can we expect george w bush and obama to be arrested and brought to the hauge ? ==sep== 0
21180 ==sep== she personally or lchestrated benghazi and then went on to sell us secrets by using her personal emails ==sep== 1
21181 ==sep== she is truly someone who deserves to be the first female president of the united states . ==sep== 0
21182 ==sep== to the front page ! ==sep== 1
21183 ==sep== because not giving illegals free stuff is racist . ==sep== 1
21184 ==sep== poor blaming gop racist bigot douchebag ! ==sep== 1
21185 ==sep== you 're just jumping to conclusions based on evidence that isn 't there yet . ==sep== 0
21186 ==sep== i agree . ==sep== 0
21187 ==sep== because having some drugs when you are in highschool is a serious crime that should take away your civil rights for life . ==sep== 1
21188 ==sep== what does it say about a grown man if he has to pay people to hang out with him ? ==sep== 1
21189 ==sep== how is she any more aggressive than any other candidate ? ==sep== 0
21190 ==sep== til facts are conspiracies to those they threaten . ==sep== 0
21191 ==sep== many no longer have to work to afford healthcare . ==sep== 0
21192 ==sep== that 's president -elect rich white man to you . ==sep== 0
21193 ==sep== but the free market is the best solution for everything . ==sep== 1
21194 ==sep== but trump is hitler ! ==sep== 1
21195 ==sep== lol that would be their first outing of the issue . ==sep== 0
21196 ==sep== well i hope hillary and all her supporters get anal fissures after harambe rapes them ==sep== 1
21197 ==sep== walmart being cheaper is a myth . ==sep== 0
21198 ==sep== yeah but then we 're technically right . ==sep== 1
21199 ==sep== if you have no loopholes and deductions it 's a lot easier . ==sep== 0
21200 ==sep== 43 and 64 doesn 't even add up to 100 % ==sep== 1
21201 ==sep== this won 't get downvoted . ==sep== 1
21202 ==sep== of course this will go straight to the front page ! ==sep== 0
21203 ==sep== the number of people who don 't realize it 's fiction is astounding . ==sep== 0
21204 ==sep== sad to say that the people who most benefit from this kind of plug -in are the least likely to use it . ==sep== 0
21205 ==sep== donald trump would be beat by either democratic candidate (save o 'mally ) . ==sep== 0
21206 ==sep== i do believe he dropped this ==sep== 1
21207 ==sep== what if he runs as hilary 's vp ? ==sep== 0
21208 ==sep== b -but she dabbed on ellen ! ==sep== 1
21209 ==sep== a sick weed addict . ==sep== 1
21210 ==sep== some people just work harder at keeping other people down than others . ==sep== 1
21211 ==sep== i like turtles ==sep== 0
21212 ==sep== only if he was president for life . . . ==sep== 0
21213 ==sep== the correct recourse world be to remove him from the flight and perhaps ban him from flying on the airline in the future ==sep== 0
21214 ==sep== why sure and that is because white people killing black people is downright patriotic to our extreme right wingers . ==sep== 0
21215 ==sep== this is the equivalent of 8 or 9 missed security briefings . ==sep== 1
21216 ==sep== president romney can breath a sigh of relief . ==sep== 1
21217 ==sep== except same sex marriage because that clearly is more damaging to society as a whole . ==sep== 1
21218 ==sep== maybe . ==sep== 0
21219 ==sep== cnn stands for clinton news network duh ==sep== 1
21220 ==sep== beating bigotry with bigotry a classic example of taking the high road . . . . . . . . . ==sep== 0
21221 ==sep== newsflash : our view of wikileaks and bradley manning is going up for exposing the *truth * ==sep== 0
21222 ==sep== we should kill their families . ==sep== 1
21223 ==sep== these single parents should have kept her knees together if she didn 't want to pay higher taxes . ==sep== 1
21224 ==sep== fortunately the job has qualifications listed and jill stein meets those qualifications . ==sep== 0
21225 ==sep== but it was her turn and also 9 /11 ==sep== 1
21226 ==sep== i 'm up 11 ! ==sep== 0
21227 ==sep== cuz the top 1 % doesn 't have enough billions already . ==sep== 1
21228 ==sep== things are going to be so different depending on who gets elected ==sep== 1
21229 ==sep== i wonder which one of his wives he was married to when this happened ? ==sep== 0
21230 ==sep== this link does not work . ==sep== 0
21231 ==sep== better yet just abolish the minimum wage ==sep== 1
21232 ==sep== he needs more water . ==sep== 0
21233 ==sep== he was appointed by a republican . ==sep== 0
21234 ==sep== this is why we should not put important government facilities in confederate states . ==sep== 0
21235 ==sep== to me it 's simply amazing that hillary isn 't doing everything her opponents want her to do . ==sep== 1

22465 ==sep== i 'm sure that the results of this report will lead to civility and finally put the matter to rest . . . ==sep== 1
22466 ==sep== it 's all so obama can appoint a super -ultra -liberal to the scotus so they can name him permanent supreme high chancellor . ==sep== 1
22467 ==sep== it would be badass to create a society where someone didn 't need to be an intruder in your house . ==sep== 0

23017 ==sep== yeah but if we could just write letters . ==sep== 1

23040 ==sep== something something . . just copying ron paul . . . i mean sanders . . ==sep== 1
23041 ==sep== well look at mr hunger games over here ==sep== 1
23042 ==sep== well obviously being deaf is just an excuse to resist arrest . ==sep== 1
23043 ==sep== because republicans generally appeal to less educated people who think their shitty diet is normal and fear change . ==sep== 0
23044 ==sep== and that addresses the subject how ? ==sep== 0
23045 ==sep== well if they weren 't so lazy they could have just gone out and gotten another job at any time ==sep== 1
23046 ==sep== it was a youthful indiscretion . ==sep== 1

23077 ==sep== now that just seems racially biased . ==sep== 1
23078 ==sep== i think jackass indicates sarcasm better than ==sep== 1
23079 ==sep== right wing libertarianism in the real world is extremely hypocritical and quite racist . ==sep== 0
23080 ==sep== because obama is pushing his healthcare agenda . ==sep== 1
23081 ==sep== or just pay out a basic weekly income and then have taxes one every other form of income . ==sep== 0
23082 ==sep== cause there 's no violence at trump rallies . ==sep== 1

23088 ==sep== the only memory i will ever have of chafee is what badlipreading did with him on their democratic debate video . ==sep== 0
23089 ==sep== that would be racist . ==sep== 1
23090 ==sep== thank goodness you 're not falling for the divide and conquer strategy . ==sep== 1
23091 ==sep== hillary had 30 years to do something about it ! ==sep== 1
23092 ==sep== nice . . . ==sep== 0
23093 ==sep== won 't know until we get rid of the scam artists known as insurance . ==sep== 0
23094 ==sep== but *a vote not for hillary is a vote for trump * remember ? ==sep== 1
23095 ==sep== but hillary is controlled by the saudi 's who donate to charities across the world in record numbers so she is worse ==sep== 1
23096 ==sep== that 's a real apples to apples comparison right there . . . . ==sep== 1
23097 ==sep== david barton writes the only accurate histories . ==sep== 1
23098 ==sep== looks like a win for both and is direct evidence against your stupid ass comment ==sep== 0

23100 ==sep== she didn 't intend to kill the orphan so its okay . ==sep== 1
23101 ==sep== it 's hard to believe she 's not in prison . ==sep== 0
23102 ==sep== there you go with that nanny -state talk . ==sep== 1
23103 ==sep== true ==sep== 0
23104 ==sep== money is free speech just like my loud speaker is ==sep== 1
23105 ==sep== or both . ==sep== 0
23106 ==sep== your comment is a disaster : ) i mean it could be vastly improved . ==sep== 0
23107 ==sep== i find it reassuring that you know how other people feel and think better than they themselves do . ==sep== 1
23108 ==sep== lol bipartisan lol ==sep== 0
23109 ==sep== it was really just michael jordan behind it all . ==sep== 1
23110 ==sep== a message from your 46th president . ==sep== 0
23111 ==sep== yeah because distributing poll workers evenly by sqft makes the most sense ==sep== 1
23112 ==sep== i feel honored . ==sep== 0
23113 ==sep== that 's a shocker . ==sep== 1
23114 ==sep== that would be different . ==sep== 1
23115 ==sep== *wealth interhitors ==sep== 0
23116 ==sep== martha stewart ? ==sep== 1
23117 ==sep== he did test positive on all his tests . ==sep== 0
23118 ==sep== it 's just a joke people stop being so pc . ==sep== 1
23119 ==sep== i think he 's referring to everyone assuming guilt despite not having all the information regarding the investigation . ==sep== 0
23120 ==sep== it helps when so many angry dumb motherfuckers are only too happy to support the koch agenda of redirecting that economic anger at other americans who work for a living . ==sep== 0
23121 ==sep== tyranny of the minority is much better ==sep== 1
23122 ==sep== when have they *not * been worthless ? ==sep== 0

23124 ==sep== citation ? ==sep== 0
23125 ==sep== no but calling a person a terrorist because just they are muslim absolutely is racist . ==sep== 0

23127 ==sep== and then he got fat again . ==sep== 0
23128 ==sep== oh jeeze this is as shocking as it will be when trump beats hillary . ==sep== 1

23130 ==sep== he was such an incredible diplomat during his time at the u .n . ==sep== 1
23131 ==sep== he 's a boxer guy . ==sep== 0
23132 ==sep== thought she already did . ==sep== 1
23133 ==sep== isn 't it great that we live in a country where we can pour over our candidates foundations and tax returns and decide if they have been honest in their dealings ? ==sep== 1
23134 ==sep== anti -virus software was turned off after clinton and aide huma adebin experienced problems sending emails obviously the first thing you try in the troubleshooting process . ==sep== 1
23135 ==sep== maybe they should just work harder ==sep== 1
23136 ==sep== i guess the nonpartisan urban -brookings tax policy center got bought by clinton too . ==sep== 1
23137 ==sep== i can 't wait for this level of micromanaging in my life ! ==sep== 1
23138 ==sep== what is the afl ? ==sep== 1
23139 ==sep== i 'm shocked ! ==sep== 1
23140 ==sep== shariah law in your food ! ==sep== 1
23141 ==sep== because asking someone to justify their opinion is completely tactless . . . ==sep== 1
23142 ==sep== hillary gets things done ! ==sep== 1
23143 ==sep== well you know the caps are justified because cisco charges royalty fees for every packet that passes over the router . ==sep== 1
23144 ==sep== because isis is our biggest threat and will kill us all ==sep== 1
23145 ==sep== it 's because they aren 't conservative enough ==sep== 1
23146 ==sep== *psssst * he made it up . ==sep== 0
23147 ==sep== hillary would never take a big check from the pharmaceutical industry and it certainly would never affect her thoughts on the issue of marijuana legalization . ==sep== 1
23148 ==sep== truth is truth regardless of the source ==sep== 1
23149 ==sep== i am sure tea baggers will protest this ==sep== 1

23152 ==sep== it 's sad that the only question that makes sense get downvoted . ==sep== 0
23153 ==sep== . . .only when doing so will protect a republican . ==sep== 0
23154 ==sep== yea because nothing will help homeless people more than unfettered access to pot . ==sep== 1
23155 ==sep== they just need to get trump to fly to dallas . ==sep== 1
23156 ==sep== yer moms should step up her game . ==sep== 0

23158 ==sep== hannihilism . ==sep== 0
23159 ==sep== i suspect that the pc factor hindered their efforts to get to the truth on this guy ==sep== 0
23160 ==sep== it 's all just sanders supporters who are angry their candidate lost . ==sep== 1
23161 ==sep== just remember the gun control motto : nobody wants to take your guns ==sep== 0
23162 ==sep== freedom of ass -ociations ==sep== 0

23164 ==sep== nah . ==sep== 0
23165 ==sep== funny how that liberal media is all owned and operated by republicans . ==sep== 0
23166 ==sep== yeah that 's why i 'm voting for trump ==sep== 1
23167 ==sep== except mel gibson ==sep== 0
23168 ==sep== the same way we enforce sex divisions in bathrooms now . ==sep== 0
23169 ==sep== it is game theory not anything on party loyalty or people 's intelligence . ==sep== 0
23170 ==sep== it was probably on the phones of those tens of thousands of muslims he saw with his own eyes cheering on rooftop parties in new jersey . ==sep== 0
23171 ==sep== guys . . . guys i know the answer . . . lets . . . double down on our policy and inject tons of money into our failed program ! ==sep== 1
23172 ==sep== stay classy pastor ==sep== 1
23173 ==sep== downvoted because you made me feel bad about my redditing behavior . ==sep== 1
23174 ==sep== i 'd rather his stigma than the clinton stigma . ==sep== 0
23175 ==sep== wow . . . that was a very information filled article ==sep== 1
23176 ==sep== you should do more research on mother teresa . ==sep== 0
23177 ==sep== but remember that hillary is the real liar . ==sep== 1
23178 ==sep== whatever their corporatist masters tell them . ==sep== 0
23179 ==sep== supporting the police and wanting them to stop being so trigger -happy are not mutually exclusive . ==sep== 0

23181 ==sep== just another example of the most transparent politician in history . ==sep== 1
23182 ==sep== it 's like the big tobacco bullshit all over again . ==sep== 0

23184 ==sep== this is bush 's fault ! ==sep== 1

23188 ==sep== the more you know . ==sep== 0
23189 ==sep== isn 't is a wonderful age we live in ? ==sep== 1
23190 ==sep== homophobia raises it 's evil head . ==sep== 1
23191 ==sep== because all hillary supporters are paid shills ==sep== 1
23192 ==sep== i think it was the advice on how to get away with killing 'urban youths ' that was the most useful there . ==sep== 1
23193 ==sep== just wait until after the debates . ==sep== 1
23194 ==sep== yea cause she hasn 't done that already . ==sep== 1
23195 ==sep== your anecdotal evidence sure has me convinced ! ==sep== 1
23196 ==sep== the reason mandate is being discussed here is because republicans since the election have been using that word . ==sep== 0
23197 ==sep== that one time a couple of busters started yelling at the convention and were so numerous that they were drowned out by wifi hotspots . ==sep== 0
23198 ==sep== well he did need to copy off his wife 's ballot . ==sep== 1

23203 ==sep== which people are you referring to ? ==sep== 0
23204 ==sep== but if we simply didn 't tax companies in any way then they wouldn 't move overseas ! ==sep== 1
23205 ==sep== but brown people are scary ! ==sep== 1
23206 ==sep== so has the war against poverty and we keep giving the poor cash . ==sep== 1
23207 ==sep== voting for the party that will immediately implement huge tax cuts for the wealthy even though it 's been proven for decades to not be beneficial to the working class will help them how ? ==sep== 0
23208 ==sep== yeah because the government is doing such a wonderful job with the va lets just let them take over the rest of the health care industy ! ==sep== 1
23209 ==sep== but it 's all okay because 'independent expenditures ' don 't give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption . ==sep== 1
23210 ==sep== yeah because we need fewer people in the political arena speaking out about the destruction of the middle class . ==sep== 1
23211 ==sep== the office is for the person the president has sex with . ==sep== 1
23212 ==sep== well i see you 've got the right attitude at least . ==sep== 1

23214 ==sep== he 's certainly not gonna endorse the jew from hymie town . ==sep== 1
23215 ==sep== because they 're the only democracy in the middle east and the greatest friend to america ! ==sep== 1
23216 ==sep== paid for by the hillary campaign ==sep== 0

23236 ==sep== a lot of white male millennials in that video . . . ==sep== 1
23237 ==sep== he had so much support from congress ==sep== 1

23240 ==sep== you forgot the fact that she ate their grandchildren alive ==sep== 1
23241 ==sep== that 's why we are loved and no one ever attacks us . ==sep== 1

23243 ==sep== bud ==sep== 0
23244 ==sep== did you not watch this election ? ==sep== 0
23245 ==sep== yeah . . . but reality has a liberal bias so it must be lying . ==sep== 1
23246 ==sep== honestly thinking bernie will be alive in 2020 . ==sep== 1

23862 ==sep== you mean the totally unbiased and factual link posted that cites actual sources ? ==sep== 1
23863 ==sep== well the 9 times thing is a stretch . ==sep== 0

23884 ==sep== democrats dont do this ever . ==sep== 1
23885 ==sep== its not racism if your a liberal ==sep== 1
23886 ==sep== or rainbow to solidify gay marihuana ==sep== 1

23902 ==sep== yeah i guess they think bernie should give up and allow clinton to gather even more political influence . ==sep== 1
23903 ==sep== that is because only white people can be racist . ==sep== 1
23904 ==sep== thank god for that doctor and his ethical and moral clarity . ==sep== 1
23905 ==sep== one of his energy advisors stated electricity is the flow of neurons . . . . . .yeah they are the smartest ==sep== 1
23906 ==sep== if republicans truly loved this country they would not even run a candidate - - - they would just agree to accept another democratic president rather than take a chance on a buffoon like trump becoming president due to the hatred and anger of so many people against the establishment . ==sep== 0
23907 ==sep== words are like bullets . ==sep== 0

23915 ==sep== it 's a conspiracy ! ==sep== 1
23916 ==sep== internal affairs aren 't exactly cops . ==sep== 0

23925 ==sep== but guys . . . i thought democrats and republicans were practically the same thing ! ==sep== 1
23926 ==sep== and they said legalizing marijuana would create jobs ! ==sep== 1
23927 ==sep== we might be safer if half the middle east is glass and what 's left is 5x as angry as they currently are . ==sep== 1

23937 ==sep== yeah they really put a gun to her head and forced her to live beyond her means . ==sep== 1

23955 ==sep== who ? ==sep== 0
23956 ==sep== but that 's ok because my team is better than your team ! ==sep== 1
23957 ==sep== yes because clearly clamping down on illegal immigration while encouraging legal immigration is white nationalism . ==sep== 1
23958 ==sep== how the fuck does anyone know their cousin 's spouse 's uncle ? ==sep== 0
23959 ==sep== a new fact is now firmly established in alaska . ==sep== 1
23960 ==sep== but he said none of those are reasons to oppose gay marriage so your argument is invalid ==sep== 1
23961 ==sep== and this is why you lost . ==sep== 0
23962 ==sep== the tpp is so conservative the obama loathing republican congress gave him fast track authority to sign it when the time comes . ==sep== 0

23966 ==sep== bernie or bust though ! ==sep== 1
23967 ==sep== thanks donald ! ==sep== 1
23968 ==sep== it 's not hypocritical - he clearly says that he only *uses * the programs without *supporting * them . ==sep== 1

23970 ==sep== the war of terror ==sep== 0

23980 ==sep== nothing fishy about this at all . ==sep== 1
23981 ==sep== i know i go to shady russian youtube stations for all of my breaking political news needs ==sep== 1
23982 ==sep== it 's just because they work harder than lazy poor people . ==sep== 1
23983 ==sep== it 's them damn liberals forcing people to ship their money overseas to protect it from taxes ! ==sep== 1
23984 ==sep== i can 't believe the gays did this to him ! ==sep== 1
23985 ==sep== but if i disagree with them their obviously an idiotic buffoon who blundered their way to success . ==sep== 1

23997 ==sep== morons on facebook . ==sep== 0
23998 ==sep== how does the electoral college prevent voter fraud ? ==sep== 0
23999 ==sep== kind of like how bernie and his supporters are racist and sexist i suppose ? ==sep== 1
24000 ==sep== i 'm sure he 's shaking in his boots because of the statement of one member of the irosh parliament . ==sep== 1
24001 ==sep== if you call smearing an opponent that has not smeared her outreach we have a problem . ==sep== 0
24002 ==sep== but what about all the jobs created . . . . ==sep== 1
24003 ==sep== that 's called business ==sep== 1
24004 ==sep== but america is the only country that matters ! ==sep== 1
24005 ==sep== we would have attacked isil where it hurt them most : iran ! ==sep== 1
24006 ==sep== the party of personal responsibility strikes again . ==sep== 1
24007 ==sep== but breaking the law and ruining a kid 's life is worth it to get those society -destroying psychedelics off the streets ! ==sep== 1
24008 ==sep== why on earth would the doj be interested in a an admittedly deliberate (by a sitting congressman ) attempt to falsify information for the purpose of obstructing and misleading a congressional investigation ? ==sep== 1
24009 ==sep== how dare you ! ==sep== 1
24010 ==sep== public flogging was the only solution ==sep== 1

24066 ==sep== we all know the only 2 kinds of people capable of operating a firearm correctly are cops and soldiers . ==sep== 1
24067 ==sep== but won 't someone think of the children ? ==sep== 1
24068 ==sep== but i thought hillary would start ww3 ? ==sep== 1

25686 ==sep== i 'm sure this is the first time anyone 's thought of this ==sep== 1
25687 ==sep== at least i did it . ==sep== 0
25688 ==sep== start another war ! ==sep== 1
25689 ==sep== but that insight requires a certain degree of political savvy . ==sep== 0

25760 ==sep== yeah the vitriolic reaction to trump that has most likely made sure he has no chance in the election certainly shows that americans are okay with rape ==sep== 1
25761 ==sep== because that worked so well last time . ==sep== 1
25762 ==sep== call sean hannity .he calls trump the blue collar billionaire ==sep== 1
