806 ==sep== thanks for taking my comment seriously . ==sep== 1
807 ==sep== ok it 's not just me ? ==sep== 0

864 ==sep== you seem like a very reasonable person who votes based on policy and character rather than anger and an immature worldview ==sep== 1

866 ==sep== what the heck ? ==sep== 0
867 ==sep== i 'm sure murdering children in cold blood will really help their cause . ==sep== 1
868 ==sep== she did nothing illegal so its all fine . ==sep== 1
869 ==sep== it 's been proven that coin tosses have a liberal bias . ==sep== 1
870 ==sep== i guess she will have to blow an intern in the oval office to take their mind off it . ==sep== 1
871 ==sep== all that time spent making up new jobs for poor lazy minorities . ==sep== 1

875 ==sep== the secret meeting that is displayed on nearly ever conservative site on the internet . ==sep== 0

880 ==sep== and yet both parties are the same . ==sep== 1
881 ==sep== nooo we 're not allowed to draw obvious comparisons between trump and dictators of the past because that 's just liberal hyperbole ==sep== 1
882 ==sep== because china is so sneaky and conniving that they 're willing to sacrifice their own short -term gains just to sell climate change to the world . ==sep== 1
883 ==sep== rolling stone hosted the boston bomber ? ==sep== 0
884 ==sep== so glad hillary used her convention to showcase new talent like obama had the opportunity in 2004 . ==sep== 1

900 ==sep== 100 % dead or paid off before he can testify . ==sep== 0
901 ==sep== that 's out of context ! ==sep== 1
902 ==sep== and rasmussen is heavily biase in favor of repubs usually giving them 5 to 9 points above any other poll . ==sep== 0
903 ==sep== but posting on reddit and the internet gives me the same sense of satisfaction as doing something but with less work . ==sep== 1
904 ==sep== yeah but she sent some emails ==sep== 1

917 ==sep== chelsea clinton 2032 ! ==sep== 1
918 ==sep== this isn 't going to get a lot worse . ==sep== 1
919 ==sep== how else can we renovate the football stadium and make it so there are now 146 less parking spots ? ==sep== 1
920 ==sep== those are different because people should be allowed to donate as much as they want when it 's to the right candidate ==sep== 1
921 ==sep== he 's only against the ones he doesn 't benefit from ==sep== 0
922 ==sep== any examples ? ==sep== 1

5174 ==sep== what pesticide product from monsanto is killing bees ? ==sep== 0

8045 ==sep== maybe by not actively attempting to sabotage it ? ==sep== 0
8046 ==sep== so in the us there is checks and balances and festering corruption ? ==sep== 0

8066 ==sep== it worked out so well in kansas and sam brownback . ==sep== 1

8096 ==sep== thats definitely the kind of leadership we want in our next president ! ==sep== 1
8097 ==sep== obviously only muslims can be terrorists ==sep== 1

8099 ==sep== hillary is so far ahead she 's shilling her books in campaign ads ==sep== 1

8112 ==sep== they 'll probably just go to republican leaning areas during the general election and block roads on election day . ==sep== 0

8143 ==sep== how many ratios should he add for each bold number ? ==sep== 0
8144 ==sep== well ya know interrupting hillary is sexist so they wouldn 't wanna do that . ==sep== 1
8145 ==sep== well yeah clearly she 's on death 's door but is also manipulating the entire media to her benefit whilst organizing murders through the shadowy cabal known as the clinton foundation . ==sep== 1
8146 ==sep== so a paid shill using social media to promote an agenda ? ==sep== 1
8147 ==sep== your panties getting all knotted up over this issue is of zero interest to me . ==sep== 0

10572 ==sep== not if you 're a star . ==sep== 1
10573 ==sep== because pragmatism is like satanism ==sep== 1

10575 ==sep== tipped scales ==sep== 0

10618 ==sep== filibuster this communist anti -capitalist marxist filth of a law . ==sep== 1
10619 ==sep== not necessarily . ==sep== 0
10620 ==sep== b -b -but stomping on the flag is an act of love for those who are oppressed ! ==sep== 1
10621 ==sep== any article blaming obama will trend upwards on fox . ==sep== 0

10627 ==sep== i think you dropped this ==sep== 1
10628 ==sep== those protests are very effective . ==sep== 1
10629 ==sep== obama is the best at commenting on things like he cares but not enough to do anything about it . ==sep== 0
10630 ==sep== can we give him trial by fire ? ==sep== 1
10631 ==sep== are they still pissed off about that video ? ==sep== 1

10634 ==sep== i 'm pretty sure it was a typo . ==sep== 0
10635 ==sep== looks like killing scalia is the gift that keeps on giving for hillary ==sep== 1
10636 ==sep== sigh sarcasm comes through so easily in text also . . . . ==sep== 1
10637 ==sep== conservatives /republicans determined to beat this topic to death . ==sep== 0
10638 ==sep== because hamas is such a legitimate threat to israel . ==sep== 1
10639 ==sep== people don 't want to think their candidate is not perfect . ==sep== 0
10640 ==sep== no one said its illegal . . . ==sep== 0
10641 ==sep== you mean he can 't build a wall 10 -15 ' high and nearly a thousand miles long ; also he 'd have mexico pay for it ? ==sep== 1
10642 ==sep== but we wouldn 't want to taint our freedom ==sep== 1
10643 ==sep== yeah but he 's really lost the minority vote ==sep== 1
10644 ==sep== but the 30 caliber clip magazines and assault pistol grips make a firearm so much more scary and efficient at eliminating babies and ethnic minorities ! ==sep== 1
10645 ==sep== legal destruction of government property . ==sep== 1
10646 ==sep== faith healing ==sep== 0
10647 ==sep== all that matters is you vote your conscience ! ==sep== 1

10651 ==sep== japanese are honorary aryans . ==sep== 1
10652 ==sep== it was motivated by obama ! ==sep== 1
10653 ==sep== that makes him smart ==sep== 1
10654 ==sep== and all it takes is one motivated individual to believe him and want to do something about it . ==sep== 0
10655 ==sep== i thought she was perfectly healthy and questioning it made you a conspiracy theorist like alex jones . ==sep== 1
10656 ==sep== just listen to them and pretty soon it will be all rainbows and vacations for everyone . ==sep== 1
10657 ==sep== we need a medical tricorder ! ==sep== 0
10658 ==sep== isn 't that covered by obamacare presently ? ==sep== 1
10659 ==sep== or hes just staying by trumps side and giving ryan the middle finger . . . ==sep== 0
10660 ==sep== the witch must burn ==sep== 1
10661 ==sep== study it out . ==sep== 0

10663 ==sep== of course you dont understand pssh beta ==sep== 1
10664 ==sep== i feel sorry for anyone that seeks employment with a texas public education anywhere on their resume . ==sep== 0
10665 ==sep== but don 't you know that the free market will provide all those things . . .eventually ? ==sep== 1
10666 ==sep== no no no . . . . you see the internet was taken over by a small pro -clinton super pac that employed 40 people . ==sep== 1
10667 ==sep== talking to someone and giving them a random name ? ==sep== 0
10668 ==sep== you forgot this : ==sep== 1
10669 ==sep== yeah . . . that 's why the crazy lady lost her election . ==sep== 1

10671 ==sep== username checks out ==sep== 1
10672 ==sep== but the advertisers win ! ==sep== 0
10673 ==sep== super pacs and the campaign can 't coordinate ==sep== 0
10674 ==sep== people were booing trump so now he takes revenge on boeing ==sep== 1
10675 ==sep== because a police officer would *never * act rashly with a firearm . ==sep== 1
10676 ==sep== i thought he looked shell shocked as well but i took it as something more like i have no idea what i 'm doing . ==sep== 0
10677 ==sep== but gravity is just a theory not a fact ==sep== 1
10678 ==sep== gotta wonder what his concession speech will sound like . ==sep== 0
10679 ==sep== if she 's lied it was most likely to save the life of a child . ==sep== 0
10680 ==sep== from canada : can confirm we are heavily censored ==sep== 1
10681 ==sep== sour grapes from candidates polling in single digits . ==sep== 0
10682 ==sep== look at the debates - that 's how he would act ==sep== 0
10683 ==sep== like all those stupid polls that showed obama ahead of romney when everyone knew from fox and rush that mitt was way ahead . ==sep== 1
10684 ==sep== that 's so much smarter than just making the police behave . ==sep== 1
10685 ==sep== because that makes so much sense if you oppose abortion ==sep== 1
10686 ==sep== your friend sounds like the picture of health ==sep== 1
10687 ==sep== *we need stronger fist control laws in this country . . . * ==sep== 1
10688 ==sep== i know right . . . why can 't everyone just speak american for crying out loud ! ==sep== 1
10689 ==sep== the measure of poise and temperament is trump . ==sep== 1
10690 ==sep== but no racism happened before obama ! ==sep== 1
10691 ==sep== oh but he did it all secretly ==sep== 1
10692 ==sep== just kick back and wait for deathrace to actually happen ==sep== 1
10693 ==sep== but it 's okay as someone in the justice department thought it was all legal so who cares . ==sep== 1
10694 ==sep== it was a joke ==sep== 1
10695 ==sep== oh i 'm sure trump wouldn 't go there ==sep== 1
10696 ==sep== exactly ==sep== 0
10697 ==sep== avalanche on bullshit mountain . ==sep== 0
10698 ==sep== hillary is evergreen and chelsea is energy . ==sep== 0
10699 ==sep== i 'm sure this spot -on analysis will win you many black voters . ==sep== 1
10700 ==sep== at least ron paul would give women a shot of useless estrogen if they could prove it was an 'honest rape ' . ==sep== 0
10701 ==sep== this is why big government needs to be stopped . ==sep== 1
10702 ==sep== sigh shoulda added ==sep== 1
10703 ==sep== i suppose it 's better for the minority to elect a demagogue than the majority . ==sep== 1
10704 ==sep== #drain the swamp ==sep== 1
10705 ==sep== relevant username ==sep== 0
10706 ==sep== please don 't get in the way of the rampant hillary hate train with your silly facts . ==sep== 1
10707 ==sep== if we eliminate entitlements and they buy their own money poverty will disappear ! ==sep== 1
10708 ==sep== don 't stop him he 's on a roll . ==sep== 0
10709 ==sep== the paid internet users are done and gone . ==sep== 1
10710 ==sep== or if the most scandalous and crooked nominee the democrats have ever run gets nominated for the general because it is her turn ==sep== 0
10711 ==sep== i 'm sure it is ==sep== 1
10712 ==sep== then lets hope he injects some science in this magic show . ==sep== 0
10713 ==sep== because a sunburn is *obviously * the worst thing that could come from climate change ! ==sep== 1
10714 ==sep== damn bleeding hear liberal . ==sep== 1
10715 ==sep== the roosevelts would like a word with you . ==sep== 0
10716 ==sep== naw man the real way to succeed is to spend all of your time at general assembly trying to build consensus . ==sep== 1
10717 ==sep== both parties are the same on climate change and war with iran . ==sep== 1
10718 ==sep== obviously had the french had stricter gun control policies they would have prevented the paris attacks ==sep== 1
10719 ==sep== so difficult to imagine a republican lying about the aca . ==sep== 1
10720 ==sep== they should stop expecting handouts and get a job ==sep== 1
10721 ==sep== very profound of you ==sep== 1
10722 ==sep== checks out ! ==sep== 1
10723 ==sep== but there are 168 hours in a week they can always work all that time to afford a place to live . ==sep== 1
10724 ==sep== because americans are constantly being killed in islamic terrorist activities . . . ==sep== 1
10725 ==sep== he forgot nixon and clinton . ==sep== 0
10726 ==sep== probably the candidate who 's supporters dont do their own research lol . ==sep== 1
10727 ==sep== dick cheney puts the callous back in conservative ==sep== 0
10728 ==sep== as bart scott said : can 't wait ==sep== 0
10729 ==sep== gays getting married is what i was told or legalizing pot or woman voting or children going to school instead of working in mines or . . . . . . . . ==sep== 0
10730 ==sep== i can only assume he meant ==sep== 1
10731 ==sep== i 've always hated lawful alignments . ==sep== 0
10732 ==sep== back in reality she 's tied in missouri with trump . ==sep== 0
10733 ==sep== it 's different because trump is a lying racist with ties to the soviet union ==sep== 1
10734 ==sep== i think we should regulate and censor the internet because it gives people too much free speech and that could enable them to spread hateful ideas very quickly and allows terrorists safe communication . ==sep== 1
10735 ==sep== til that there is only one pharma co and it 's not american . ==sep== 0
10736 ==sep== must be another the _donald brigade ==sep== 1
10737 ==sep== france is still smarting from his successful boycott of their products . ==sep== 1
10738 ==sep== like your parents for example ==sep== 1
10739 ==sep== i 'm being sarcastic . ==sep== 1
10740 ==sep== maybe others will also see the fallacy of libertarianism . ==sep== 0
10741 ==sep== it never stopped bush . ==sep== 0
10742 ==sep== working for america is soooo bad . ==sep== 1
10743 ==sep== when he chose to be born in kenya . . obviously . . ==sep== 1
10744 ==sep== but facts are biased towards liberals . ==sep== 1
10745 ==sep== let 's start by being fair first . . . ==sep== 0
10746 ==sep== but holt and clinton conspired to have these word come out of trump 's mouth . ==sep== 1
10747 ==sep== that 's how you know its a conspiracy soo deep the conspirators have fallen for it ==sep== 1
10748 ==sep== grist is a reputable source . ==sep== 0
10749 ==sep== but the will care about galveston . ==sep== 0
10750 ==sep== when did they ever believe in the american dream ? ==sep== 0
10751 ==sep== might as well stay home and not vote then am i right ==sep== 1
10752 ==sep== no . . no no . . clean * *carbon -neutral * * coal ftfy ==sep== 0
10753 ==sep== i think your view may be a bit skewed because you get to live in austin . . . ==sep== 0
10754 ==sep== the pizza guy who is now warning of obama causing the end times ? ==sep== 0
10755 ==sep== you mean people who have no mathematical chance of winning ? ==sep== 0
10756 ==sep== hillary will insist on adding an h to the end of all words . ==sep== 1
10757 ==sep== no flaw in that system . ==sep== 1
10758 ==sep== the people *funding * it or the people *in * it ? ==sep== 0
10759 ==sep== you misspelled resign ==sep== 0
10760 ==sep== i think i 'll run right out and donate $50 to bernie because he really has a chance . ==sep== 1
10761 ==sep== liberalism = devil worshipping ==sep== 1
10762 ==sep== he was being tolerant . ==sep== 1
10763 ==sep== obviously obama is just not as smart as trump . ==sep== 1
10764 ==sep== solyndra is the fast and furious of the republican party before fast and furious became benghazi . ==sep== 0
10765 ==sep== the fact that prc and roc both declare themselves the one china doesn 't exactly help matters either . . . ==sep== 0
10766 ==sep== but he says he 's doing it for the middle class and he wouldn 't lie to us because he isn 't a politicain ==sep== 1
10767 ==sep== and it 's been working so well the last 5 years . ==sep== 1
10768 ==sep== that perfectly describes what happened here . ==sep== 1
10769 ==sep== i am jack 's complete lack of surprise . ==sep== 0

10774 ==sep== thats my presidential candidate ! ==sep== 0
10775 ==sep== one in the same ==sep== 0
10776 ==sep== divide and conquer . ==sep== 0
10777 ==sep== more like naive enough to think billionaires and corporations give them billions of dollars just to be nice ==sep== 0
10778 ==sep== very comparable ==sep== 1
10779 ==sep== they were never *hers * to begin with ==sep== 0
10780 ==sep== they elect a non -voting representative to the house . ==sep== 0
10781 ==sep== stop being so pc ==sep== 1
10782 ==sep== he gonna come get you at night . ==sep== 1
10783 ==sep== better than she is at playing a native american . ==sep== 1
10784 ==sep== but the french are socialists and have death panels . ==sep== 1
10785 ==sep== she did that several times . ==sep== 0
10786 ==sep== my sports team is better than your sports team \ *shoves face full of doritoes * ==sep== 0
10787 ==sep== he 's just tellin ' it like it is ==sep== 1
10788 ==sep== but apple stuff just workstm ! ==sep== 1
10789 ==sep== because a minimum wage hinders people from finding work . ==sep== 1
10790 ==sep== i thought it was lgtbbq ? ==sep== 1
10791 ==sep== you can do that ? ==sep== 1
10792 ==sep== that was sexist ==sep== 1
10793 ==sep== they 'll lively just buy up the rest of the seats next to them and fill them with interns . ==sep== 0
10794 ==sep== real insightful analysis of our political history there . ==sep== 1
10795 ==sep== free markets ! ==sep== 1
10796 ==sep== well it 's a good thing we have all these voter id laws in place to prevent stuff like this from happening . ==sep== 1
10797 ==sep== well pence wasn 't running for president ! ==sep== 1
10798 ==sep== he 's been pretty consistent in what he says at all his rallies ==sep== 0
10799 ==sep== and that 's why obama is responsible for this act of terrorism ==sep== 1
10800 ==sep== and abbott lost the use of his legs when an oak tree fell on him while he was jogging after a storm in houston . ==sep== 0
10801 ==sep== clinton says a lot of things . ==sep== 0
10802 ==sep== and thus trumptv was born and lo it spewed it 's ugliness on the world ==sep== 0
10803 ==sep== it 's all for our safety and to fight terrorists ==sep== 1
10804 ==sep== like a chiropractor . ==sep== 0
10805 ==sep== they 've owned up to it pretty well and discussed how they played pundit when they shouldn 't have . ==sep== 0
10806 ==sep== obviously no one dislikes trump unless they are paid to . ==sep== 1
10807 ==sep== how did i know this would be the top comment ? ==sep== 0
10808 ==sep== i really just want to thank you for proving my point ==sep== 0
10809 ==sep== i welcome the day where we stop thinking critically about the content contained inside of articles to determine the legitimacy of the arguments being forwarded . ==sep== 1
10810 ==sep== that makes him smart . ==sep== 1
10811 ==sep== nothing like a good lynch mob ==sep== 1
10812 ==sep== is it you ? ==sep== 0
10813 ==sep== so just pay a subscription fee to a private company that tracks these things . ==sep== 1
10814 ==sep== she forced trump to tell her she was beautfiul . ==sep== 0
10815 ==sep== they catch everyone but they only stop the republicans . ==sep== 1
10816 ==sep== and definitely just a coincidence . ==sep== 1
10817 ==sep== but at least nobody snorted a xanax ! ==sep== 1
10818 ==sep== way to respond to the point . . . ==sep== 1
10819 ==sep== what did it help in specific ? ==sep== 0
10820 ==sep== a 4 trillion dollar stimulus ? ==sep== 0
10821 ==sep== you 're just saying that because you fear a strong conservative woman . ==sep== 1
10822 ==sep== and the attacks being baseless . ==sep== 0

10828 ==sep== i 'm glad the cops have nothing better to do than kick a woman out of the woman 's restroom . ==sep== 1

10831 ==sep== but the republicans ! ==sep== 1
10832 ==sep== imagine if fdr owned a hotel in germany in the 30s ==sep== 0
10833 ==sep== clinton foundation ==sep== 0

10849 ==sep== because isolated incidences should decide policy . ==sep== 1
10850 ==sep== that would be a great start but it 's not that easy - even if we cut the dod budget in half (by 200 -300 billion /yr ) that 's still not going to be enough to fix our budget problems . ==sep== 0

10861 ==sep== perhaps lauer is more scared of trump setting up his own tv network if he loses the election than of trump being elected president . ==sep== 0
10862 ==sep== because it 's anti -hillary news and this is r /politics . ==sep== 0
10863 ==sep== he forgot the ==sep== 1

16905 ==sep== i should have added a ==sep== 1
16906 ==sep== this isn 't r /liberatarian please delete thing . ==sep== 1
16907 ==sep== neither was obama ! ==sep== 1

16912 ==sep== probably the pipes in your residence . ==sep== 0
16913 ==sep== he was giving those children solid work skills and the ability to get a job when they get out of school . ==sep== 1

16915 ==sep== kansas ' budget has been doing pretty well with its massive tea party tax cuts . ==sep== 1
16916 ==sep== she should be deported . ==sep== 0
16917 ==sep== r .i .n .o . ==sep== 1
16918 ==sep== i 'm glad we have such an educated and responsible electorate ==sep== 1
16919 ==sep== and supply side economics works 100 % of the time . ==sep== 1
16920 ==sep== i 'm so surprised that there 's no mention on r /politics of how the same poll shows hillary increasing her national lead over sanders from 19 points in december to 25 now . ==sep== 1
16921 ==sep== i personally think the term natural born citizen is discriminatory to citizens born via c -section . ==sep== 1
16922 ==sep== has obama said the v word yet ? ==sep== 0
16923 ==sep== what a pathetically scathing attack comment you 've posted . ==sep== 1
16924 ==sep== that and medical advancements ==sep== 0
16925 ==sep== welp time for another crusade it looks like ==sep== 1
16926 ==sep== i 'm sure if dems were majority they would be completely open to a conservative president assigning conservative judges . ==sep== 1
16927 ==sep== for refusing to endorse a man that clearly goes against his values and policies ? ==sep== 0
16928 ==sep== you lost . ==sep== 0
16929 ==sep== no way this was stage ! ==sep== 1
16930 ==sep== *colour ==sep== 1

16932 ==sep== no it 's all just a republican smear campaign . ==sep== 1
16933 ==sep== would you also say that the iraqi war was a good idea because at the time polls showed that it had huge popular support ? ==sep== 0
16934 ==sep== clearly all the emails were written between putin and assange and donald . ==sep== 1
16935 ==sep== the cities can relate to eachother yes thank you for agreeing with me . ==sep== 0
16936 ==sep== but . . . i thought the defunding health benefits would stop people from needing the services they had ? ==sep== 1
16937 ==sep== so if we can just get the shootings up even higher we should see crime fall off completely . ==sep== 1
16938 ==sep== canada . ==sep== 1
16939 ==sep== yes and as you can see their stock prices tumbled after the profits caps were announced . ==sep== 1
16940 ==sep== so we should now be regulating private business profits because they choose to pay the minimum wage ? ==sep== 0
16941 ==sep== she did say yes and when she saw him macking on another woman she than said he 's dead ==sep== 0
16942 ==sep== i know my personal wealth almost doubled in the last 5 years . ==sep== 1
16943 ==sep== can 't wait to see how the polls react to this one . ==sep== 0
16944 ==sep== that 's fine but the real option is a corrupt washington insider who thinks transperency and accountability are bad words vs a uneducated highschool bully ==sep== 0
16945 ==sep== actually being progressive ==sep== 1
16946 ==sep== i 'm confused . . . i thought the gop 's official position was that government shouldn 't be telling private businesses to do things they aren 't comfortable with . ==sep== 0
16947 ==sep== looks like the only one who can stump the trump is trump himself . ==sep== 1
16948 ==sep== probably opposed to state owned and private prisons for the same reason ==sep== 1
16949 ==sep== you 're absolutely correct . ==sep== 0
16950 ==sep== talk about semantics ==sep== 1
16951 ==sep== that 's exactly why we should close the border to all christians . ==sep== 1
16952 ==sep== think of the day when we can finally link the name trump with loser ==sep== 0
16953 ==sep== i thought this only happened in the south . ==sep== 1
16954 ==sep== it is about time this campaign started to get interesting . ==sep== 1
16955 ==sep== or that obama is just one of the best public speakers we have ever seen . ==sep== 0
16956 ==sep== kasich just defunded planned parenthood in ohio ==sep== 0
16957 ==sep== to quote ron white : you can 't fix stupid . ==sep== 0
16958 ==sep== something we we all wish for ourselves . ==sep== 0
16959 ==sep== everyone knows he replaced it with a bust of stalin ==sep== 1
16960 ==sep== you 're obviously a sexist if you think that ==sep== 1
16961 ==sep== just making america great again ! ==sep== 1
16962 ==sep== must all be part of trump 's plan ==sep== 1
16963 ==sep== very presidential . ==sep== 1
16964 ==sep== anything less would be typical leftwing socialist politics . ==sep== 1
16965 ==sep== someone didn 't read the article . ==sep== 0
16966 ==sep== your comments about the domain add nothing to the conversation . ==sep== 0
16967 ==sep== but it 's just the free market . . . ==sep== 1
16968 ==sep== isn 't it great to know that our appointed officials are now operating above the law ? ==sep== 1
16969 ==sep== there 's literally no difference between palestine and mexico ==sep== 1
16970 ==sep== i like how everybody finds their own unique reason to hate trump ==sep== 0
16971 ==sep== except it does . . . as many well known economists agree on . ==sep== 0
16972 ==sep== well then all those jew loving republicans better vote for him then . ==sep== 1
16973 ==sep== well obviously because that plot didn 't target americans . ==sep== 1
16974 ==sep== i knew this would happen ! ==sep== 1
16975 ==sep== i think they dropped this ==sep== 1
16976 ==sep== jenniferlawrencethumbsup .gif ==sep== 0

16982 ==sep== read all about it in his new book . . . ==sep== 1
16983 ==sep== yeah maybe bernie should create an email scandal just for all the extra press ! ==sep== 1
16984 ==sep== keep on phonebanking . ==sep== 0
16985 ==sep== i wonder how much these shills were paid for the life of their dead son . ==sep== 1
16986 ==sep== of course they forgot to mention the fbi supplied the underwear . . . ==sep== 1
16987 ==sep== the speed of light was constructed to store photons . ==sep== 1
16988 ==sep== actually it 's impossible for corporations to lose money because they 're evil ==sep== 1
16989 ==sep== here 's a conspiracy theory : maybe pence and conway are purposefully discouraging trump from attending these briefings so trump doesn 't go tweeting classified information at 3 am . ==sep== 0
16990 ==sep== obama still is in office he 's taking our guns away anyday now ! ==sep== 1
16991 ==sep== that attitude should be good for business . ==sep== 1
16992 ==sep== it 's how they pretend trump didn 't lose . ==sep== 0
16993 ==sep== but voting is hard q -q ==sep== 1
16994 ==sep== til a cop is not the police . ==sep== 0
16995 ==sep== i guess now we like that southern belle lindsey graham . ==sep== 0
16996 ==sep== easy fix : just give them some (more ) tax breaks to offset their losses . ==sep== 1
16997 ==sep== don 't forget about the emails ! ==sep== 1
16998 ==sep== still sexy . ==sep== 0
16999 ==sep== it happened in the 1968 election . ==sep== 0
17000 ==sep== it 's much better your president lies to get you into a war than to keep people from finding out you let a fat girl blow you . ==sep== 1
17001 ==sep== you must have missed last nights episode where she called for the nationalization of every major industry . . . ==sep== 1
17002 ==sep== does he know what they do to adulterers in theocracies ? ==sep== 0
17003 ==sep== could it be because the entire msm has promoted racism at every opportunity ? ==sep== 0
17004 ==sep== he could : a ) raise money for progressive primary candidates b ) stump for progressive primary candidates c ) endorse progressive primary candidates d ) mention progressive primary candidates which of those has he done ? ==sep== 0
17005 ==sep== fascinating . ==sep== 1
17006 ==sep== sweet a four month old article . ==sep== 0

17013 ==sep== but they were white ==sep== 1
17014 ==sep== hopefully more like the party of more people voted for anyone other than trump . ==sep== 0
17015 ==sep== right i totally forgot when obama started the war in afghanistan . ==sep== 1
17016 ==sep== corruption is only what 's illegal ==sep== 1
17017 ==sep== eventually automation is cheaper than h1 -b 's too . ==sep== 0
17018 ==sep== rekt ==sep== 1
17019 ==sep== why would they spend so much money denying something that doesnt exist ? ==sep== 1
17020 ==sep== because sarah palin told me there 'd be death panels . ==sep== 1
17021 ==sep== fully agree . ==sep== 0
17022 ==sep== they probably say hillary was the 19th 9 /11 hijacker or at least that 's what i 'll just assume and never follow up on ==sep== 1
17023 ==sep== disrespectful tone you pc brah ? ==sep== 0
17024 ==sep== record : corrected thank you ==sep== 1
17025 ==sep== where we 're going we don 't need space ! ==sep== 1

17028 ==sep== you sound like an upstanding citizen . ==sep== 1
17029 ==sep== thank goodness that has never happened with a democracy ==sep== 1
17030 ==sep== can 't really compare a push or shove to being waterboarded . ==sep== 1
17031 ==sep== what about the bodily autonomy lost when a man is forced to work and pay child support for a child he may not have wanted ? ==sep== 0
17032 ==sep== we need to watch carefully to see if she 's blinking help me in morse code during tv appearances . ==sep== 0
17033 ==sep== i really wish i could give a dozen up votes for this comment . ==sep== 0
17034 ==sep== and taking advantage of that cheap housing is just called good business ! ==sep== 1
17035 ==sep== i know i wasn 't invited to the party but mind if i piss in the punch bowl ? ==sep== 0
17036 ==sep== why hasn 't he done this already ? ==sep== 0
17037 ==sep== right . . . because mass domestic servailamce and indefinite detention without a trial is soooo constitutional ==sep== 1
17038 ==sep== amazing how simple it really is ! ==sep== 1
17039 ==sep== but those young 'uns don 't bother voting ! ==sep== 1
17040 ==sep== was it holstered or was be brandishing it . ==sep== 0
17041 ==sep== these two things must be totally unrelated and in no way have racist intent . ==sep== 1
17042 ==sep== actually i 'm more willing to roll the dice and shake shit up than accept more of the same . ==sep== 0
17043 ==sep== so why are people so dissatisfied with obama ? ==sep== 1
17044 ==sep== what 's that ? ==sep== 1
17045 ==sep== haha good one ==sep== 1
17046 ==sep== weekend at trumps ==sep== 0

17049 ==sep== pre -thriller mike would like a word ==sep== 0
17050 ==sep== say hello to your future king . ==sep== 1
17051 ==sep== moderate indies are an anathema . ==sep== 1
17052 ==sep== but . . .but . . .democrats and republicans are just different sides of the same coin ! ==sep== 1
17053 ==sep== do you really want trump as president ? ==sep== 1
17054 ==sep== but war helps the economy . . . ==sep== 1
17055 ==sep== which was totally what he was trying to do ==sep== 1
17056 ==sep== great source ; we all stand corrected ! ==sep== 1
17057 ==sep== solid retort you 've convinced me ! ==sep== 1
17058 ==sep== jk lol doesn 't matter because the judge declared no take backsies . ==sep== 0
17059 ==sep== she supported civil unions long before it was popular ==sep== 0
17060 ==sep== you are arguing the merits of dogs over guns because they are less deadly this is pointless goodbye ==sep== 0
17061 ==sep== luckily trump is totally putting her in prison . . . ==sep== 1
17062 ==sep== might be part of his plan to ensure reelection ==sep== 1
17063 ==sep== i saw thar truck near hillary clinton 's house after she was asked to publish the speech transcripts . ==sep== 1
17064 ==sep== but but . . . competition drives down costs ! ==sep== 1
17065 ==sep== is anyone really surprised that the guy who ran his campaign on lies and bs actually lied to the voters about his intentions . . ==sep== 0
17066 ==sep== it would be much better for them to not say anything and have the gun be used in a violent crime ==sep== 1
17067 ==sep== oh you 're such an obama hater ! ==sep== 1
17068 ==sep== lol ==sep== 0
17069 ==sep== from the party and state that thinks they own women 's uteruses . ==sep== 0
17070 ==sep== ass a former congressman you can 't help but trust this guy . ==sep== 1
17071 ==sep== which is why they 're running on the most liberal platform in history . ==sep== 1
17072 ==sep== just remember . . .president obama is only nominating someone as a political stunt and has absolutely nothing to do with governing the country . ==sep== 1
17073 ==sep== but any vote not for clinton is a vote for trump ! ==sep== 1
17074 ==sep== solid reasoning ==sep== 1
17075 ==sep== and how will perry help with the diversity problem ? ==sep== 0
17076 ==sep== how about we just blame white people instead ? ==sep== 1
17077 ==sep== fucking scrubs need to stop complaining and just eat the shit sandwich like the rest of us . ==sep== 1
17078 ==sep== he flies coach . ==sep== 0
17079 ==sep== you forgot the ==sep== 1
17080 ==sep== are they literally managing a candidate 's presidential campaign ? ==sep== 0
17081 ==sep== about fucking time someone stood up to the electorate . ==sep== 1
17082 ==sep== well at least the kids can go watch their football team . . . . .right ? ==sep== 1
17083 ==sep== those two things aren 't mutually exclusive . ==sep== 0
17084 ==sep== i 'm sure this will go exactly as bloomberg expects heading into the midterms ==sep== 1
17085 ==sep== well . . . there it goes . . . welcome to communism i guess . . . . people will really miss their freedoms . ==sep== 1
17086 ==sep== that 's exactly how the ccw trained person would react ==sep== 1
17087 ==sep== not the entire election but part of it . . . ==sep== 0
17088 ==sep== how else do you expect them to stop the sjws from censoring speech ? ==sep== 1
17089 ==sep== way to put yourself in their shoes ==sep== 1
17090 ==sep== you really should seek help ==sep== 0
17091 ==sep== obviously news reporters that work for clinton are more trustworthy than professors . ==sep== 1
17092 ==sep== good thing that has no chance of escalating tensions with china . ==sep== 1
17093 ==sep== that 's sexist ! ==sep== 1
17094 ==sep== we also have to ensure that there are fewer companies providing access to the internet to continue to make the market . . . . . .more vibrant . ==sep== 0
17095 ==sep== if they do they will soon be in mentioned history books together with the whig party . ==sep== 0
17096 ==sep== ya your reply right shouldnt have the calories or ingredients on them either just google it . ==sep== 1

17102 ==sep== the dirty esjay -doubleyou thought police have gone too far ! ==sep== 1
17103 ==sep== a well thought out counterpoint to the article jfrat71 . ==sep== 1
17104 ==sep== yeah because infowars and alex jones are just the most reputable journalists ==sep== 1
17105 ==sep== trump would make a great leader but i can 't say this publicly because an entire ethnicity would rightfully hate me . ==sep== 1
17106 ==sep== yes because no democrats were talking about income inequality until sanders came around . ==sep== 1
17107 ==sep== context and precedent is just a straw man ! ==sep== 1
17108 ==sep== that 's because republicans didn 't let him spend the money . ==sep== 1
17109 ==sep== ooohhh . . .a trump scam . . .that 's never happened before ! ==sep== 1
17110 ==sep== ya i get the whole israel criticism against clinton but does anyone else care about how hillary (very likely negatively ) will affect our relationship with russia ? ==sep== 0
17111 ==sep== hopefully the anti -vaxxers can unite and send a little cash trumps way ==sep== 1
17112 ==sep== it sounds like the guard was an asshole about it but it is apparently against the law to bring in books . ==sep== 0
17113 ==sep== true ==sep== 0
17114 ==sep== it 's rigged ! ==sep== 1
17115 ==sep== but both parties are exactly the same ! ==sep== 1
17116 ==sep== you should have gone to the fortune teller more frequently and paid them to foresee the future in which you would lose that job before ever having the child . ==sep== 1
17117 ==sep== so how much did you sell your account for ? ==sep== 1
17118 ==sep== what a true hero she is ==sep== 1
17119 ==sep== times like this i 'm glad as hell texas is going purple and he 'll likely be a one term senator . . . ==sep== 0
17120 ==sep== wow talk about delusional . ==sep== 0
17121 ==sep== he 's 70 but he is the oldest person to assume to presidency . ==sep== 0
17122 ==sep== because everyone knows black parents have hypnotic control over their children ==sep== 1
17123 ==sep== whereas no one on the right every threatened obama 's life . ==sep== 1
17124 ==sep== i do hear joe lieberman avoids bald black men with purple lightsabers . ==sep== 0
17125 ==sep== thanks reagan . ==sep== 1
17126 ==sep== but at least he 's not a dingo . . . ==sep== 0
17127 ==sep== no they are just standing up against the murderous clintons who shamefully tried to discredit them . ==sep== 1
17128 ==sep== what is it with you reality -based people and your obsession with facts ? ==sep== 1
17129 ==sep== it might have been positive when he mentioned it . ==sep== 0
17130 ==sep== great endorsement ! ==sep== 1
17131 ==sep== but . . .but . . .but . . .she 's raising so much more money than donald trump . ==sep== 1
17132 ==sep== i hope you just forgot to add the ==sep== 1
17133 ==sep== the only place i actually see any of that being reported is when police officers attempt to expose corrupt policy handed down by the politicians in charge . ==sep== 0
17134 ==sep== bernie better watch out before he becomes an sjw and shoves socialist policies and progressive views down our throats ==sep== 1
17135 ==sep== because she 's obviously a huge champion of all those things ==sep== 1
17136 ==sep== keep telling yourself that . ==sep== 0
17137 ==sep== it will shoot to the top like a rocket . ==sep== 1
17138 ==sep== so we 're the _donald ? ==sep== 0
17139 ==sep== i live in kentucky and am afraid that 's what bevin is going to do if he hasn 't already . ==sep== 0
17140 ==sep== and taxes are literally armed robbery ! ==sep== 1
17141 ==sep== stop being sexist ! ==sep== 1
17142 ==sep== i have no problem with that . ==sep== 0
17143 ==sep== well then you must be a racist ! ==sep== 1
17144 ==sep== nopenopenopenopenopenope ==sep== 1

17149 ==sep== why do you hate libertarians ? ==sep== 0
17150 ==sep== yup the 94 crime bill and the welfare reform she helped push sure was a net positive . ==sep== 1
17151 ==sep== so how do you know what percentage they represent ? ==sep== 0
17152 ==sep== i concede . ==sep== 0
17153 ==sep== the man definitely has his priorities in order . ==sep== 1
17154 ==sep== let 's not forget it was an illegal donation . ==sep== 0
17155 ==sep== yeah but the new york times is owned by a mexican ==sep== 1
17156 ==sep== or maybe he can do what rand paul did and just run away . ==sep== 0
17157 ==sep== whatever you say boss . ==sep== 1
17158 ==sep== real ? ==sep== 1
17159 ==sep== how could you compare the assassination of a brown terrorist to intruding on the rights of americans ? ==sep== 1
17160 ==sep== just remember since labor is 100 % of the costs of a product the cost of a good will increase yugely ! ==sep== 1
17161 ==sep== someone forgot the ==sep== 1
17162 ==sep== everyone who disagreed with madame popular should have dropped out because it was her turn ==sep== 1
17163 ==sep== someone just left their samsung plugged in . ==sep== 1

17171 ==sep== taking fat rails of fairy dust is how sanders camp got where it is today . ==sep== 0
17172 ==sep== iran was looking pretty good until we killed mosaddeq but hey at least we stopped communsim from sprouting there . ==sep== 1
17173 ==sep== i wonder why msm outlets aren 't paying important stuff like this more attention . ==sep== 1
17174 ==sep== you obviously don 't work in our legal system if you haven 't heard the term new jim crow . ==sep== 0
17175 ==sep== shouldn 't a twist be unexpected ? ==sep== 1
17176 ==sep== don 't forget the horrifying leftist media . ==sep== 1
17177 ==sep== how can anyone stop the mexican rapists if they have no experience committing sexual assault ? ==sep== 1
17178 ==sep== because trump rugged the primaries . ==sep== 1
17179 ==sep== she is essentially a republican ==sep== 1

20022 ==sep== it was sarcasm broooooo . ==sep== 1
20023 ==sep== you mean the guy who would run for either party is a moderate ? ==sep== 1

20053 ==sep== yeah but they are more efficient so who cares ? ==sep== 1
20054 ==sep== hugo boss ? ==sep== 0
20055 ==sep== because r /politics says so . . ==sep== 1
20056 ==sep== but clinton is the crooked one . ==sep== 1
20057 ==sep== i can 't wait until you pay for me to go to college ! ==sep== 0
20058 ==sep== so whats the latest score in this game terrorists vs cops ==sep== 1

20061 ==sep== it must feel great to have that privilege . ==sep== 1
20062 ==sep== now we can teach those kids a lesson ! ==sep== 1
20063 ==sep== so the fact it 's impractical is purely coincidental . ==sep== 0
20064 ==sep== is the poster making the nearly sacrilegious claim that more guns and a free shot law is not decreasing gun deaths ? ==sep== 1
20065 ==sep== cause evil trump is racist and want to kill black people ==sep== 1
20066 ==sep== can 't imagine if that happened like that it would be good for the democratic party in the election . ==sep== 0
20067 ==sep== keep telling yourself that . ==sep== 0

20526 ==sep== i don 't think assault is included in the legal consequences of free speech . ==sep== 0

20528 ==sep== . . .with the full force of the united states military . ==sep== 1
20529 ==sep== i kind of like his routine stump speech right now . . . ==sep== 0

20538 ==sep== ward connerly ? ==sep== 1
20539 ==sep== how can a union that small contribute that much money ? ==sep== 1
20540 ==sep== but you 'd let him do it because he 's a star . ==sep== 1
20541 ==sep== you 're not allowed to say that here join the circle jerk or leave ==sep== 1
20542 ==sep== it 's their own fault for being too poor or lazy to go get the id . ==sep== 1

20544 ==sep== they trade lobster and filet mignon for hooch and crack cocaine ! ==sep== 1

20546 ==sep== this seems like a legit and non biased study . ==sep== 1
20547 ==sep== are you saying the racist groups that the charleston shooter referenced were liberals ? ==sep== 0
20548 ==sep== why should it be assumed that a video of someone spray painting a word on a vehicle after others had threateningly held a finger in the general direction of them would be staged ? ==sep== 0
20549 ==sep== stay lying . ==sep== 0
20550 ==sep== i have a brother that consistently votes republican and told me last night that all the candidates scare the shit out of him . ==sep== 0
20551 ==sep== more than 3 or 4 % . ==sep== 0
20552 ==sep== because the former co -chair of hillary 's 2008 campaign never talked or coordinated her actions with the 2016 clinton campaign ? ==sep== 1
20553 ==sep== i realize it can be easy to forget that making an accusation automatically counts as guilt but try to remember it ==sep== 1
20554 ==sep== oh that must be what khan was referring to . ==sep== 1
20555 ==sep== yeah they should pass something like cispa to keep reddit from every doing this kind of damage again . ==sep== 1
20556 ==sep== but how can a socialist /marxist program lead to greater capitalism ? ==sep== 1
20557 ==sep== and it 's closer to vermont . ==sep== 1
20558 ==sep== no . ==sep== 0
20559 ==sep== and that 's why we have the electoral college . ==sep== 0
20560 ==sep== but people who study 16th century ventriloquism add just as much to society as doctors do ! ==sep== 1
20561 ==sep== isn 't he busy now leading the knights of the vale ? ==sep== 0
20562 ==sep== maybe they don 't want to be hunted down by the ministry of truth . ==sep== 1
20563 ==sep== he likes soldiers who don 't die . ==sep== 0
20564 ==sep== but . . .but jobs are seasonal in july ! ==sep== 1
20565 ==sep== that biased liberal media is constantly using trump 's own words against him instead of twisting them to mean what he retroactively says they meant . ==sep== 1
20566 ==sep== democrats would never stoop to that level ==sep== 1
20567 ==sep== saying that we should believe a pathological liar over our intelligence community makes perfect sense . ==sep== 1
20568 ==sep== but if someone is bad you must treat them as 100 % wrong . ==sep== 1
20569 ==sep== right wing lies ==sep== 0

20571 ==sep== because we have to do something ! ==sep== 1
20572 ==sep== fyi you are missing the ==sep== 1
20573 ==sep== because the federal worker is evil just like teachers etc . . . ==sep== 1
20574 ==sep== i guess you missed the show he did on her emails and the clinton foundation correct ? ==sep== 0
20575 ==sep== you forgot the ==sep== 1
20576 ==sep== i thought trump and bernie were agreed on so many issues ! ==sep== 1
20577 ==sep== i think pat roberts ought to attack them for handing out the tools of abortion . ==sep== 1
20578 ==sep== but but but but he said he would put it in a blind trust run by his children so he wouldn 't profit from his policies . . . . . ==sep== 1
20579 ==sep== that must be why they are supporting him so adamantly ==sep== 1
20580 ==sep== wasn 't this supposed to be the damning evidence that could finally end clinton 's reign of tyranny or something like that ? ==sep== 0
20581 ==sep== cruz isn 't counting on winning the election as mush as he is counting on negotiating for it . ==sep== 0
20582 ==sep== wow this is the first bush to ever lie to the public . ==sep== 1

20592 ==sep== you gotta admit our conservatives /republicans are devilishly clever . ==sep== 0
20593 ==sep== now can we call him a nazi ? ==sep== 1

20609 ==sep== they must have stopped calling that silent majority ==sep== 1
20610 ==sep== and didn 't we learn that that 's pay -for -play if done through the clinton foundation ? ==sep== 0
20611 ==sep== because uprooting your entire life and moving to the other side of the country is an easy thing to do . ==sep== 1
20612 ==sep== i feel like people are mistaking his obnoxious confidence for honesty ==sep== 0

20617 ==sep== salty you are . ==sep== 0
20618 ==sep== by banning assault weapons amirite ? ==sep== 1

20624 ==sep== im sure the poor guy was suffering from a mental illness . ==sep== 1
20625 ==sep== good luck with that . ==sep== 0

20632 ==sep== that 's his cross to bear . ==sep== 0
