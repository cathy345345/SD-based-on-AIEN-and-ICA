25759 ==sep== we should probably restrict voting rights to land owners . ==sep== 1
25760 ==sep== yeah the vitriolic reaction to trump that has most likely made sure he has no chance in the election certainly shows that americans are okay with rape ==sep== 1
25761 ==sep== because that worked so well last time . ==sep== 1
25762 ==sep== call sean hannity .he calls trump the blue collar billionaire ==sep== 1

25796 ==sep== and people who think that capitalism is bad and workers need to seize the means of productions aren 't necessarily marxists . ==sep== 1
25797 ==sep== me and all my friends were bernie supporters and i 've never seen a hillary supporter on the internet who wasn 't obviously being paid a million dollars to comment so the only explanation is that there were 3 million voters magicked into existence by evil dws ! ==sep== 1

25801 ==sep== i think christie is just terrified of something that might make him want to eat even more . ==sep== 0
25802 ==sep== the pc police is hear wee woo wee woo ==sep== 1
25803 ==sep== well this obviously invalidates the entire prolife movement ==sep== 1

25806 ==sep== gotta love the birthers ==sep== 1
25807 ==sep== starts with r . . . must be a lie devised by russians looking to blame an imaginary country . ==sep== 1
25808 ==sep== a legal argument can definitely be made . ==sep== 0
25809 ==sep== i don 't think he 's breaking ranks at all . ==sep== 0

25815 ==sep== maybe folks don 't all fit neatly into your stereotypes . ==sep== 0
25816 ==sep== she probably thinks hrc stands for hillary (is ) right campaign ! ==sep== 1
25817 ==sep== another more likely explanation is that you have a comprehension deficit . ==sep== 0
25818 ==sep== we all are ==sep== 0

25826 ==sep== if her state votes to ban self -driving cars she can always drive for uber ! ==sep== 0
25827 ==sep== because \ *prod prod \ * ! ==sep== 1
25828 ==sep== have we ruled out that she simply makes her ~ ~servants ~ ~ secret service agents carry her around out of spite ? ==sep== 1
25829 ==sep== i get my news from a rock music magazine ! ==sep== 1

25841 ==sep== it 's judicial activism through inaction ! ==sep== 1
25842 ==sep== that sounds like a low t denier comment . ==sep== 1
25843 ==sep== it sounds like the homeless needs some lobbyists . ==sep== 1
25844 ==sep== strategy is just a form of vote rigging . ==sep== 1
25845 ==sep== a single payer healthcare provider should not decide in death panels who gets treatment - when a quick look at your bank account gives the answer how much better you managed your own life so far to pay all hospital bills easily by yourself ==sep== 1

25936 ==sep== romney is changing his position on iran to appease the most conservative wing of israeli government . ==sep== 0
25937 ==sep== then i shudder to think what will happen if crazy -trump makes the supreme court choices . . . yikes ! ==sep== 0
25938 ==sep== yeah because racist idiots are capable of critical thinking ==sep== 1
25939 ==sep== how dare clinton attempt to get as many votes as possible ==sep== 1
