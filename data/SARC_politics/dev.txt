22999 ==sep== good lord these troll accounts . . . ==sep== 0
23000 ==sep== they just think they need healthcare . ==sep== 1
23001 ==sep== so the event that caused hundreds of gun control bills to be introduced and created a hysteria across the nation is to be shrouded in secrecy ? ==sep== 0
23002 ==sep== oboomba is breaking people ! ==sep== 1
23003 ==sep== rage quits are best quits . ==sep== 0

23010 ==sep== but . . . but . . . but . . . hope . . . and change . . . and stuff . . . ==sep== 1
23011 ==sep== that is one of the odd things ; conservative business owners hate it when employees discuss their wages with each other . ==sep== 0
23012 ==sep== keep in mind that these same people probably see the people they are intimidating as second class citizens or worse . ==sep== 0
23013 ==sep== right because the nsa functions on pettiness ==sep== 1
23014 ==sep== where is sam fischer ? ==sep== 1
23015 ==sep== obviously hitlerally bribed him and this means nothing in regards to her candidacy ! ==sep== 1
23016 ==sep== why would i trust an old white man with a girl 's name ? ==sep== 1
23017 ==sep== yeah but if we could just write letters . ==sep== 1
23018 ==sep== i wonder if she will address powell 's emails . ==sep== 1
23019 ==sep== to distinguish observational science from historical science ==sep== 1
23020 ==sep== and take his resources . ==sep== 0
23021 ==sep== what if i 'm a lazy and spoiled white person just looking for a hand -out ? ==sep== 0

23024 ==sep== ( ( (globalists ) ) ) ==sep== 1
23025 ==sep== i feel like this is a peaceful protest though . . . ==sep== 0
23026 ==sep== along with their democrat counterparts . . . or perhaps the democrats are secretly cybermen ? ==sep== 0

23028 ==sep== free market capitalists ? ==sep== 0
23029 ==sep== i sense some ==sep== 1
23030 ==sep== we wouldn 't get because we poor . ==sep== 1
23031 ==sep== and do absolutly nothing to change anything ==sep== 0
23032 ==sep== the flying monkey legion (fml ) ==sep== 0
23033 ==sep== fixed : the * *in * *justice department . . . ==sep== 0
23034 ==sep== you 're not the first to say it ; ) ==sep== 0

23037 ==sep== i think you dropped this . . . ==sep== 1
23038 ==sep== but don 't vote for trump because he never talks about the fact that big american corporations no longer make many products in the united states . ==sep== 1
23039 ==sep== all that stuff is probably in storage . ==sep== 0
23040 ==sep== something something . . just copying ron paul . . . i mean sanders . . ==sep== 1
23041 ==sep== well look at mr hunger games over here ==sep== 1
23042 ==sep== well obviously being deaf is just an excuse to resist arrest . ==sep== 1
23043 ==sep== because republicans generally appeal to less educated people who think their shitty diet is normal and fear change . ==sep== 0
23044 ==sep== and that addresses the subject how ? ==sep== 0
23045 ==sep== well if they weren 't so lazy they could have just gone out and gotten another job at any time ==sep== 1
23046 ==sep== it was a youthful indiscretion . ==sep== 1
23047 ==sep== that also caused clinton to lose the general because bernie is a selfish asshole who attacked clinton while clinton laid off of him during the primary ! ==sep== 1
23048 ==sep== artificially increasing the price of a commodity decreases the *demand * for that commodity . ==sep== 0
23049 ==sep== something something you lost something something heil trump ==sep== 0

23055 ==sep== schroedinger president heisenberg vp ==sep== 0
23056 ==sep== we should hate them for investing their money instead of giving it away . ==sep== 1
23057 ==sep== and democrats are ever so concerned about respecting traditions . ==sep== 1
23058 ==sep== trump causing violence yet again . ==sep== 1
23059 ==sep== her first action will be to put herself back on the banking committee ==sep== 1

23070 ==sep== someone forgot the ==sep== 1
23071 ==sep== what about a birth control implants that are only removed when somone is sufficiently funded for kids ? ==sep== 1
23072 ==sep== what no terrorism charges ? ==sep== 1
23073 ==sep== so he 's always happy ? ==sep== 1

23075 ==sep== he forgot the ==sep== 1
23076 ==sep== spanking would not work in florida because they have stand your ground law and anyone can carry a gun . ==sep== 1
23077 ==sep== now that just seems racially biased . ==sep== 1
23078 ==sep== i think jackass indicates sarcasm better than ==sep== 1
23079 ==sep== right wing libertarianism in the real world is extremely hypocritical and quite racist . ==sep== 0
23080 ==sep== because obama is pushing his healthcare agenda . ==sep== 1
23081 ==sep== or just pay out a basic weekly income and then have taxes one every other form of income . ==sep== 0
23082 ==sep== cause there 's no violence at trump rallies . ==sep== 1
23083 ==sep== i trust you because you are on the internet and probably an expert scientist . ==sep== 1

23089 ==sep== that would be racist . ==sep== 1
23090 ==sep== thank goodness you 're not falling for the divide and conquer strategy . ==sep== 1
23091 ==sep== hillary had 30 years to do something about it ! ==sep== 1
23092 ==sep== nice . . . ==sep== 0
23093 ==sep== won 't know until we get rid of the scam artists known as insurance . ==sep== 0
23094 ==sep== but *a vote not for hillary is a vote for trump * remember ? ==sep== 1
23095 ==sep== but hillary is controlled by the saudi 's who donate to charities across the world in record numbers so she is worse ==sep== 1
23096 ==sep== that 's a real apples to apples comparison right there . . . . ==sep== 1
23097 ==sep== david barton writes the only accurate histories . ==sep== 1
23098 ==sep== looks like a win for both and is direct evidence against your stupid ass comment ==sep== 0

23109 ==sep== it was really just michael jordan behind it all . ==sep== 1
23110 ==sep== a message from your 46th president . ==sep== 0
23111 ==sep== yeah because distributing poll workers evenly by sqft makes the most sense ==sep== 1
23112 ==sep== i feel honored . ==sep== 0
23113 ==sep== that 's a shocker . ==sep== 1
23114 ==sep== that would be different . ==sep== 1
23115 ==sep== *wealth interhitors ==sep== 0
23116 ==sep== martha stewart ? ==sep== 1
23117 ==sep== he did test positive on all his tests . ==sep== 0
23118 ==sep== it 's just a joke people stop being so pc . ==sep== 1
23119 ==sep== i think he 's referring to everyone assuming guilt despite not having all the information regarding the investigation . ==sep== 0
23120 ==sep== it helps when so many angry dumb motherfuckers are only too happy to support the koch agenda of redirecting that economic anger at other americans who work for a living . ==sep== 0
23121 ==sep== tyranny of the minority is much better ==sep== 1
23122 ==sep== when have they *not * been worthless ? ==sep== 0

23133 ==sep== isn 't it great that we live in a country where we can pour over our candidates foundations and tax returns and decide if they have been honest in their dealings ? ==sep== 1
23134 ==sep== anti -virus software was turned off after clinton and aide huma adebin experienced problems sending emails obviously the first thing you try in the troubleshooting process . ==sep== 1
23135 ==sep== maybe they should just work harder ==sep== 1
23136 ==sep== i guess the nonpartisan urban -brookings tax policy center got bought by clinton too . ==sep== 1
23137 ==sep== i can 't wait for this level of micromanaging in my life ! ==sep== 1
23138 ==sep== what is the afl ? ==sep== 1
23139 ==sep== i 'm shocked ! ==sep== 1
23140 ==sep== shariah law in your food ! ==sep== 1
23141 ==sep== because asking someone to justify their opinion is completely tactless . . . ==sep== 1
23142 ==sep== hillary gets things done ! ==sep== 1
23143 ==sep== well you know the caps are justified because cisco charges royalty fees for every packet that passes over the router . ==sep== 1
23144 ==sep== because isis is our biggest threat and will kill us all ==sep== 1

23195 ==sep== your anecdotal evidence sure has me convinced ! ==sep== 1
